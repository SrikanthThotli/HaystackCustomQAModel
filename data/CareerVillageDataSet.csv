I want to become an army officer. What can I do to become an army officer?," Hi. I joined the Army after I attended college and received a Bachelor is Degree in Criminal Justice.  Commissioned officers enter the Military with a four year degree or receive officer training after joining and complete a tour. You can prepare yourself by taking Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) while in high school or a university. You can also attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) after graduating from college or become commissioned by earning a professional degree. If you decide to earn a degree, think about what you would like to do while in the military.  The experience in the military was very rewarding. I wish you well and much success in your future.  "
I want to become an army officer. What can I do to become an army officer?," Dear Priyanka,  Greetings! I have answered this question to Eshwari few days ago. I am going to reproduce that answer with bit of modifications as required for better clarity.      From your background, I could make out that you are from Bangalore and a student of 10th standard but your location is Rhode Island, USA. So I am not very clear as to which Army you wish to join ? Is it the US Army or the Indian Army? It is important to know that very few foreign nationals can join Indian Army (like Nepali citizens etc.). So you have to ascertain for yourself as to which citizenship you hold and accordingly you can join armed forces of the respective countries. Both are highly professional armies and respected a lot. I shall answer the modalities about the Indian Army, assuming that is the natural choice.     So, to answer your query, there are following options for you to become army officer:    Do your B.Sc  and that will be good as you have wider choices including flying branches in air force and executive branches in Navy. Similarly BA/B.Com if you are not looking for flying or executive branches.     Should you wish to be doctor in Army then you can appear for entrance Test for AFMC, Pune or Army Dental College after class 12th with PCMB. However, you can do the same by attending Medical colleges from civil institutes in India/abroad.     You can also join Military Nursing Services after B.Sc or Diploma in Nursing but majority of them are trained within army organisations (after 12th only  with PCMB).    You can join after doing your graduation in Engineering (Civil, Mech, Electrical, Electronics or Computer Sciences) or Masters in Physics with Electronics or Computers for engineering branches.  You can also join in Education Corps by doing M.Sc/MA/M.Com with or without B.Ed or in Legal services by doing your Law Degree.       After your basic education, application and selection test processes, one has to clear SSB (Services Selection Board) which is a very stringent 5 days test (compulsory for all including Women officers except medical professionals). It is one of the best methods of test I know to assess the suitability for military services (as officers), a proven method of testing of one is psyche, leadership qualities which takes  all the aspects of your personality into account and decide.  Although, success rate is pretty low but do not get disheartened and demotivated. Key to success in SSB is a sound mind with sound body, positive attitude and basic IQ.  If I could do with an average IQ and humble  educational backgrounds, why not you?  There were many friends (within my batch) of whom we thought that they will never make it to the SSB but they did qualify and now serving as  Major General.   Please refer the links given below and you can find scores of material to read about SSB on the net or through books.  All the Very Best! Jai Hind! &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;   "
Will going abroad for your first job increase your chances for jobs back home?," I work for a global company who values highly international experience.  In fact, that is a key experience we look for in candidates.  Therefore, I would say it would be wise to take advantage of the teaching opportunity - even if only for a year or 2.  You never know where it might lead and you will certainly have an edge on your return if you then look for employment in a global company. "
"To become a specialist in business  management, will I have to network myself?","I agree with Denise. Every single job I have had since my first internship in college, I have found through connections. I have also been surprised that in some cases, connections that I least expected were crucial in helping me find new opportunities. For example, I am about to start a new role that in a lot of ways, is my dream job. A few months ago, I connected with someone that used to be on my team at a different company. We only worked on the same team for about 2 months, and 5 years later, ended up working at another tech company in Seattle. He ended up being the hiring manager for this new role, and after passing the other interviews, I got the job.   I would say the most important thing when starting your career is to define what you want your brand to be, and what you want to be known for. This will help give you guidance on what activities and events to prioritize, books to read, etc.   It is also essential to be mindful of the impression you leave with others. While networking is essential to building your career, it is important that it is also backed up by a reputation you feel proud about.   As a student, I remember this feeling like an incredibly daunting task. It made it easier for me to find a group I could relate to. I joined ALPFA, an association for Latino Professionals that work across various business disciplines. I would recommend finding an organization that speaks to you, and begin practicing your networking skills there."
"To become a specialist in business  management, will I have to network myself?","Networking is a key component to progressing your career.  I have worked for several high tech organizations over many years and each job I was offered was because I knew someone who worked at the company who knew my skills and was able to advocate for me to get the job.  Without my professional and personal networks, it would have been much harder to get job offers and I may not have been as successful in my career.     Depending on the type of business/industry you would like to be in, you may have to start out as a team member or team contributor to grow your expertise in the business, possibly around a particular business function like operations, finance,  sales, etc.   As you become more knowledgeable and show your strengths in conducting your day to day work,  you will have a good chance to become a manager or leader of a team.   I do encourage you to take every networking opportunity that comes your way - join professional organizations, maybe your company or school offers networking activities you can join, and stay close to your social networks, you never know when a friend will help you find your next career move!

"I want to become a doctor because of my great interest in science and helping people, but can I major in something that is not science oriented?","Of course!

what kind of  college could i go  to for a soccer player, Hi Rodrigo!   The important thing to remember if you are going to pursue professional sports is what are you going to do when you career is over?

What are the college classes like for and graphics design major?," If you like doing creative work, graphic design would be appropriate and much higher chance of landing a job rather than a fine arts degree (unless you want to try your luck in animations). From my personal experience, I have always been creative since elementary but I brushed if off cause I lived in a country where artists are frown upon and jobs were scarce around that area.      Throughout my college years, I was a nursing major for one semester then a computer science for a year and half but I could not stop drawing or painting in between it all. By my junior year, I decided to pick up a part-time job at a printing company, where I would use my artistic skills as a graphic designer.      From there, I knew I wanted to come back to my creative skills cause I really enjoy it.      My advice, try out graphic design courses and painting. To see the differences and what kind of creative work you would want to do.  "
What are the college classes like for and graphics design major?,"Hi Torrey,  when I went to school at university we had to take some required classes first such as basic drawing and  basic graphic design, typography, then we had to apply to get into the specific program we wanted (graphic design, illustration, or print production). The teachers made the selection based on a portfolio of projects we had from the basic classes. Once I got into the 2 year design program I had more advanced classes on logo design, page layouts, typography, history of graphic design, product packaging design and professional design practices (how to manage the professional design process, how to deal with clients, copyright etc).  Hope this helps.   Best of luck, enjoy your creativity!"
what does it take to be an anesthesiologist?,"     Hi Deja,   Know we are recommending a lot of videos for you, but here is a nice one that follows anesthesia resident Dr. Jesse Hill on a typical day as he works on the Obstetric anesthesia rotation at the Stanford University School of Medicine:        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20YzbPVIzmE&amp;feature=related    "

How does the gender gap effect productivity in the work force?," Gender differences in access to economic opportunities are frequently debated in relation to gender differences in labor market participation.   participation  focus on productivity and earnings—for two reasons. First, a focus exclusively on labor force participation provides only a partial picture of women’s and men’s experience in the labor market. Far from being a simple decision about whether or not to join the labor force, participation in market work involves reallocating time across a variety of activities—a process that can be difficult and costly, particularly for women. And a focus solely on participation masks gender differences in the nature and dynamics of work. Second, despite significant progress in female labor force participation over the past 25 years  pervasive and persistent gender differences remain in productivity and earnings across different sectors and jobs. Indeed, many women around the world appear to be caught in a productivity trap—one that imposes significant costs on women’s welfare and economic empowerment today and serious disincentives to invest in the women of tomorrow. Despite lower earnings and productivity, women are not worse farmers, entrepreneurs, and workers than men. We argue instead that gender differences in labor productivity and earnings are primarily the result of differences in the economic activities of men and women— although gender differences in human capital and in the returns to worker and job characteristics also play a role.

"As a civil engineer, what percent of your time would you say per week you spend on site helping to organize construction efforts and people and what percent of your time do you spend in an office making calculation and coming up with designs?"," It all depends on what type of job you have. In my days as a new Civil Engineer, I also spent my full days either drafting or making calculations. During my structural design days, I spent all hours of the day in the office making calculations. Never saw a project.  When I hit Public Work things changed. I did visit project sites, did project administration, did calculations and other administrative work. The amount of time spent on the various items was completely dependent on the project and what was happening. You can go days without getting out of the office and then you can spent an inordinate amount of time in the field. It is extremely variable. I loved it! "
"As a civil engineer, what percent of your time would you say per week you spend on site helping to organize construction efforts and people and what percent of your time do you spend in an office making calculation and coming up with designs?","Sort of on top of what Myron said, the ""correct"" answer is it varies.  Being a civil engineer is a vary wide ranging and encompassing profession, from designing bridges to working with construction contractors in the field to managing projects & funds in the office.  It really is up to you where you want to take it, and while it can be somewhat difficult to find a position that you can do all three, they are definitely out there.  My advice would be to try and get internships in college or even just a day or two shadowing in high school or later in three different places: a private consulting firm (i.e. AECOM, or a local equivalent), a construction contractor (like Kiewit), and a state or local government office (like a Dept of Transportation).  While there are many varying roles within these sorts of organizations, the attitude of who you work for will shape you more than what you are doing."
what is the hardest about becoming a lawyer?,"The lawyer response is, ""it depends!"" Each person is different.  I thought the prep was okay, but I struggled with the legal writing and research.  My roommate really struggled with the testing, but aced the writing part.  All of us struggle with employment at times in our life.  It is going to depend on your own individual circumstances.  The entire process is designed to be difficult, but doable, if you are capable.  Your best bet is to develop good study habits now, practice for the tests, draft your entry essay early, and once you are in, ask for help early and often, develop a network of peers to assist as you study, and be ready to work hard and read a lot!"
what is the hardest about becoming a lawyer?,The hardest parts of becoming a lawyer are graduating from law school near the top of your class and passing the bar examination on your first attempt.
"How to have a board that can attract $500,000 capital for a non-profit start up"," Hi Cynthia -     First of all congratulations on having a well-thought out plan for your non-profit.  You have shown a lot of initiative that this will help you go far.  Board development is one of the most important things for a new organization to focus on.  Members of your board help you establish credibility and ideally open their networks to you, both to raise visibility and of course, funds.     While community financial institutions are not my area of expertise, I will give you some tips that should be helpful in general.  As your main need is for this board to be a funding/fundraising board for a community financial institution, that arena is where you need to look for individuals to invite onto your board.  First, look at your own networks:    Are any of your friends, community members, relatives, friends' relatives in finance?  Can you approach them with your idea, see what they think and then invite them to join your board?    Look at similar institutions - community financial institutions (CFIs).  Are there individuals on their boards that you can invite onto yours?  Once you have a core group of individuals on your board (not all need to have finance backgrounds - some can have HR experience or be from the community you are trying to help), then you need to put a fundraising plan in place.  It would be helpful to have at least one board member who has fundraising experience.  The fundraising plan should have concrete steps as to how the organization is going to reach its initial goal ($500,000), what is the timeline, what are the steps, etc.  Once you have your plan, then each member of the board should be encouraged to contribute and to help with fundraising in any way they can.  Your plan should have options for commitment - dollar amount, amount each board member will help raise, what networks they can introduce you to, to help fundraise, etc.   Board development should be customized for each organization as it is important to get a good mix of people on the board, and who hopefully have good chemistry working together.  Your board chair should be the person you work closely with to help you keep other board members focused on their commitments.     Being at Harvard should help you access alumni networks, ask your professors for ideas on who should be on your board (perhaps one of them would agree to serve).  Having a couple of big names helps attract others.     Hope this is helpful - wish you the very best!       "
"How to have a board that can attract $500,000 capital for a non-profit start up"," Hi Cynthia,  Shalini has given you some excellent advice. My only other thought is to look into potential organizations that can help support your business plan. In CA (specifically Cal Poly)  there are organizations such as the Small Business Development Center (SBDC), Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and HotHouse. All within the college environment and all with the mission of supporting student businesses while you are in school. They provide several areas of support, including board development. Perhaps Harvard has something like it or a connection to something similar. Here is a link to SBDC that will lead you to the other two. Best wishes on your endeavor.  http://sbdc.calpoly.edu "
To be a dental hygienist or a dentist?," Cierra, Both professions are great but do not think of it as ""making the money"". Do what you enjoy the monetary rewards will come. I have been practicing for 27 years as a RDH. I did make an effort to apply to dental school after 6 years as a hygienist but did not get admitted. I am very happy now that I did not. As Dr. Barnett mentioned, as a hygienist, the schedule is very flexible if you want to have a family. Little did I know I would still be practicing but I have recently started teaching as a part-time adjunct clinical instructor.  Every dental hygiene program has different requirements for their program so make sure you look at each one. Most programs are a 4 year but their are some 2 year associate programs. Then, if you want to do a  completion of BS in dental hygiene you may. Other students have done a BS in science base degree then had options to apply to dental hygiene or DDS program. Whatever you decide, do not let the monetary part drive you, let the profession drive you to be and do your best. The best to you! "
To be a dental hygienist or a dentist?," Hi Cierra,   Working in the Oral Health care field is about being passionate with it and wanting to take care of people is Oral Health independently of the money you could make. Choosing a profession is about what you love to do . You will do well if people see in you a professional that is truly focused on their needs. Patient is first.   Dentistry is a 4 year career (minimum - you never stop studying ) , but you have to have at least 2 years in College in a pre-dental program ( Sciences) before.

To be a dental hygienist or a dentist?," Dental school would cost a lot more, but you make a lot more over your career. My mom was a hygienist, and I am a dentist. Always jobs in both.

Is it better to sell your invention idea(s) to a company or raise money to patent it yourself?," lakeya,     You have an excellent question.   As with most excellent questions, the answer is - it depends.  What does it depend on?  A couple things:     1)  Could your invention be a business?  - Not all inventions can.  Some inventions might solve a problem in a way that is superior to any other, but if it can not be scaled (e.g. can not be manufactured in a way that brings cost below price by a sustainable margin, is not sufficiently differentiated from competition to attract customers, market of potential customers is not large enough to justify start-up costs, etc.) then there is no business.  Keep in mind though - just because one person may not be able to turn an invention into a business does not mean it does not have value.   An invention could be patented and then sold (or licensed) to a company with complementary characteristics from which value could be derived from synergies between the invention and their existing product (e.g. the company already has an established presence in the target market of the invention, the company manufactures their existing product in a similar way such that existing infrastructure could be utilized).      2) Do you want to be an entrepreneur?   - If your invention could be a business that you could start yourself, the next question to ask is whether you want to be an entrepreneur.   Successful entrepreneurs often work long hours for long periods of time trying to get their businesses off the ground, and even then success is scarce.  Read about successful entrepreneurs (and unsuccessful entrepreneurs) to learn more about the sheer size of the risks and rewards involved, and whether such a lifestyle works for you (one insightful resource from an experienced entrepreneur - http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)     After careful reflection, if you are leaning toward 'yes' to both questions, then starting down the path of launching a business is next.  If not, then selling (or licensing) your inventions to another individual or company with the means to bring it to market might be the best path.  Whether you decide to start your own business or sell / license your invention as is, you will likely want to apply for a patent.   Patenting a product is not cheap (https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-much-does-a-patent-cost), but it is likely much cheaper than costs needed to launch a business.  Here is a good article I stumbled across that may be helpful on the topic of applying for patents (https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/204918).     I am far from an expert on this topic, but hopefully these thoughts help you find a path to more relevant resources.  Best of luck to you! "
Is it better to sell your invention idea(s) to a company or raise money to patent it yourself?," A patent&nbsp; is a government authority or license conferring a right or title for a set period, especially the sole right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention.(got this from BING)&nbsp;So you only get paid if you own the idea or license. So you would need to find a patent attorney to patent your idea so that you have the right to sell it.&nbsp; So you can not sell it to a company until you have the patent which gives you ownership of the idea. IF&nbsp; you go to a company and share the idea with them they have no obligation to pay you for it unless you own the patent for that idea. "
Is it better to sell your invention idea(s) to a company or raise money to patent it yourself?," So some people see the universe as it is. Some look and see the holes. I have always been one to see the holes, the things that dont exist and COULD exist. The problem is, does the rest of the universe care?  I have spent my whole life seeing the holes and I have tried filling many of them. Most of the time the universe did not care but on a few, I have had great success. The key to seeing a hole in the universe and filling it with your idea is the brand, the marketing and a lot of dumb luck. So if you are starting out, try to get someone to take your idea and run with it. You will likely come across some greedy bastards who will steal it, but if the well is deep enough you will come up with more. The odds of you knowing enough now to make it successful are pretty low. You will need 20 years of dealing with greedy bastards to know how to do it all on your own.  "
Who/what do you think truly decides where you go to college?,"I do not have a specific answer. I have some questions though....  1. In an ideal world, most students should answer ""What is YOUR reason for attending a specific college""? Mine was cost at first. I attended a local community college. I thought I was just there because I was saving money, but I learned very quickly that some of the most incredible professors teach at community colleges!!  2. ""Is your school choice to please yourself""? Ultimately, I became extremely happy with my college choices. As an undergrad, I had the most AMAZING professors who taught at community colleges, because that is what they loved doing! My abilities and dreams grew leaps and bounds, and I did not spend a lot of money that I did not have.   3. ""Are you attending because you have found your calling""?  In my opinion, this question is more important the higher up the academic world you climb. As an undergraduate for my first A.A., I went to a community college that I could afford while working in the writing lab. Undergraduate education is somewhat uniform in terms of the type of general education classes required. For me, I looked more at what was important to me in a school for my BA I wanted to teach, so I selected a college that specialized in teaching. I stayed at the same women is college for grad school, because I loved the professors who already knew me and the work I was doing. They challenged the heck out me in grad school! Probably, because by grad school, they knew my weaknesses and my strengths. I returned to community college for a second AA  degree because the college and the students, staff, faculty, and admin were all soooo amazing.   4. I have noticed some students attend schools because their parents did.  In my opinion, the question here is: ""Are you pursuing the work you really want to do""? None of my parents had degrees, so I selected a women is college for my advanced education, because I was influenced by a professor who knew I wanted to teach. The single BEST decision I ever made! I was influenced by an educator that knew me, and she more or less dropped me off there and told me to ""start finding out about the opportunities there"". I had no idea that it would be the most challenging and rewarding experience of my life. "
Who/what do you think truly decides where you go to college?," There are a number of factors that go into such a big decision, and I am sure these factors and how much they weigh in the decision vary from person to person and depending on each situation. I would think that financial reasons would and should be very high on the list of factors, because depending on how much education you need for your career, the debt can grow very quickly. Although input from counselors, family and friends matters, they are not the ones who will be putting in the hard work or paying off that debt years later, so in my opinion, those are secondary. A lot of people have a favorite school for different reasons, such as sports, proximity to a certain city, or they have a good program in a particular field, or their parents or other family members are alumni and had a great experience. I would think about your career goals and research the best schools in that field, and in the meantime, apply for financial aid/scholarships/grants. If your career goals include graduate school, then cost for undergraduate education are all the more important in your decision. Once you have narrowed down your choices, you should absolutely visit the school to get a feel for the place and the students and faculty - if you feel comfortable and 'at home' then you will know it right away! And of course if you know people who have gone to that school recently, then ask a lot of questions about their experience, and what they like/do not like about it. All of these factors will help you to make the right decision. Best of luck to you! "
Who/what do you think truly decides where you go to college?," There are a lot of factors that go into the choice of college.  Family finances and geography are big ones - it is much cheaper to live at home and go to a local school.  Financial aid packages vary widely, sometimes making it cheaper to go to a private school than a state school.  Another element is how parent is feel about a students course of study - should the child follow their passion and study art or music, or should they pursue something more practical?  This can be tricky, with plenty of emotion on all sides.  Economic figure in, too.  Some people can afford to retrain if their dream career does not work out, other do not want to take a chance on it.  I have just gone through this with my daughter, now a college freshman.  It was tough, but I think we struck a good compromise. "
Who/what do you think truly decides where you go to college?, There are definitely several factors that influence a decision on where you go to college. Here are a few things that I remember thinking about. Best of luck! 
How can I get my work in Android development noticed by prospective users?," You can add it to your signature when you send out an email.  Do not make it too pushy, but at the end of your signature you can make a reference to it.       The same can be said of Social Media, when you post something just add it to the end of your post so that people can see it and then they may become more interested in looking at it on the playstore. "
How can I get my work in Android development noticed by prospective users?," You have to get the buzz going about it, so that people who are using it are referring it to their friends. Add functionality to your app that supports that (e.g. allow a user to share a good experience they had with your app to social media).     Also check if users who use your app are returning after they used this once. Collect feedback from users to understand what they liked and did not like and how you can change the experience for them to come back and recommend your app to others. "

Which topics in college most helped with your career in Industrial Psychology?," When I was an undergraduate student, there were NO courses in I-O psychology at my school; there are now, though.   So, the courses that I found the most useful as an undergraduate were: Statistics Research Design Tests and Measurement Social Psychology   So, if you think you are interested in I-O Psychology, find a school that has at least one course  offered in this sub-discipline.  I would also recommend going to a school with at least one professors who does research in the field so that you can gain some experience by doing an independent study with her/him!   Good luck!   Should you have any additional questions, do not hesitate to contact me. "
How easy/hard is it to find a job in architecture?,"To get a good job one needs to be trained or prepared.  With good training and a good work effort, I believe everyone can secure a good paying job. So the first thing I would do is narrow down your field of interest to get the appropriate training. Business and marketing require very different training than architecture and engineering.  Both fields will have pros and cons. Do you like building projects, working on business plans, travel, working outside etc.?  Look on the internet, under each of the areas and get a feel for the jobs.  Most jobs will require math but engineering and business have very different math course requirements.  Once you figure out which general direction you are interested in, make sure you work on the requirements and find a in-state college/university’s that has that program if possible.  You don’t want to be saddled with a huge college debt.  Good luck. "
How easy/hard is it to find a job in architecture?," Well getting a job is fairly easy in a big city, however, large firms know that they can pay way less cause everyone wants to work there for the experience. So, you could spend 5 years getting an Arch degree only to get out of school making 36k to 40k to start, which is not bad, but you will be living in the hood or you will have to deal with room mates living in a nicer area. I switched over to engineering drafting and ended up capping out at 50k, if I wanted to keep going in that field I could have ended up making 70k.  Lots of jobs, just will not make you rich unless you go at it alone, but then you need to be cert in your state &amp; have the stamp. "
"If medicine improves and allows people to live much longer lives, how will we provide for everyone?"," Hi Sophie,       Really interesting question you have posed. Based off of your comment above, you seem to be concerned about the environmental impact of a growing population where people live longer and longer lives. So there is a term for the population that the earth can environmentally support, and that is called the ""carrying capacity"". Thomas Malthus put out a theory in the 19th Century that there is a finite population that the earth can support and and anything leading that could lead to mass famine, disease, and starvation. Thankfully Malthus' prediction has yet to come true but it is a real worry. The resources on earth are finite, that is true, but human ingenuity is pretty incredible.      We human have so far been able to invent ourselves out of ecological issues before ( think about the advent of nitrogen based fertilizers and the Green Revolution).  While the problems and issues that we face ecologically and environmentally are great, I choose to believe that our intellect, creativity, and ingenuity will save us...it has in the past at least.  Also, what is limiting us to staying on Earth?  We humans are explorers, perhaps one day interstellar space travel will actually be a reality and we will be able to inhabit other worlds, the possibilities are endless.      Keep thinking creatively and push yourself to think outside the box, our future depends on it.     Best,  Austin  "
"If medicine improves and allows people to live much longer lives, how will we provide for everyone?"," Hi Sophia such a wonderful question. To give you an example of how life expands to accommodate everyone we have homes, apartments, cars, jobs, careers, colleges, food that seem endless. We grow as the community grows. We also have programs for the elderly (some states have meals on wheels which is lovely). Life expands for us and accommodates our needs. We have senior living residents, Perpetual Home Care In-Home companion and Personal Senior Care, etc). The good news is that we need not fear our increased life expectancy as we are increasingly able to maintain our bodies in a fit and healthy state and more and more of the illnesses associated with old age come under our control. Living until the age of 90 in 50 years time, will be a very different experience to someone living to that age 50 years ago. In February this year, a US scientist estimated that retirement age could reach 85 by 2050. Shripad Tuljapurkar of Stanford University claimed that anti-ageing advances could raise life expectancy by a year each year over the next two decades. As we get older healthier, then there is no reason why we should not continue our active, productive lifestyles for longer. This would have substantial benefits; we could extend a mortgage over a longer period, we would have longer to invest in a pension, and simply have more time to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves.  (Excerpt) Viewed globally, the lengthening of life spans seems independent of any single, specific event. It didn’t accelerate much as antibiotics and vaccines became common. Nor did it retreat much during wars or disease outbreaks. A graph of global life expectancy over time looks like an escalator rising smoothly. The trend holds, in most years, in individual nations rich and poor; the whole world is riding the escalator.

Why are there not more females that help or support other females in college?," Hi Vanessa, thanks for submitting a question! In college, I was a part of an organization called OHIO Women in Business. Our mission was to attract women to the college of business, develop them through various workshops and speakers, and successfully launch them into the workforce upon graduation. Does your college have a women is organization for your major? If not, have you considered starting your own? Start talking to an adviser or mentor about this! I was friend is with the woman who started the organization at my school and all it takes is an idea and passion to help you implement it!     If you are apart of a woman is organization and feel you are not doing enough, look into Zonta Club. It is an international organization whose mission is to empower women through service and advocacy. I am a member and love getting involved in the volunteering and fundraising events. Here is the international website:  https://foundation.zonta.org/     My last piece of advice would be to read ""Lean In."" This will spark or increase your energy to really understand the gender gaps that still exist in today is society.  Here is a link to the book is website: https://leanin.org/book     Wish you all the best and hope this helps!    "
Why are there not more females that help or support other females in college?," Hi there Vanessa. This is a loaded question! Sometimes I think that it is a competition thing that prevents some from extending a hand. I did not really experience that when I was in college thankfully, but I also set up meetings for groups of women to study/meet. I believe that we have to be the change that we want to see. I made sure to smile and say hello to everyone that I met in order to make friends. Do not get me wrong, there were some women that did not say hi back or did not seem too friendly, but the good outweighed the bad by a long shot!   I would also recommend looking online for groups in your area or finding clubs that you can join. Once you find a group of women that are about empowerment and support, you will be in good shape! I hope this helps! "
Why are there not more females that help or support other females in college?," Hi Vanessa, Unfortunately some women can be very competitive with each other.  However, I have found that women can also be very supportive of each other.  Try to join some groups in school that are catered towards women.  Come with an noncompetitive, supportive spirit to the other women in your school and find other women to join you.  Together you can a strong supportive group to grow together in. "

i am searching college for engineering in civil or computer in US and  i am from nepal with medium economy," Working and going to school at the same time can be tough. But, if you apply to some schools, they might be able to help you with grant and scholarship money. Money can be given based on need and/or good grades. The financial aid office of the college would be able to tell you wait applications you need to complete.   Good Luck! "
i am searching college for engineering in civil or computer in US and  i am from nepal with medium economy," I recommend looking into universities in Canada. The quality of education from a university like the University of Waterloo or University of Toronto is comparable to top schools in the US, but at a fraction of the cost. Another benefit of the University of Waterloo is their co-op program. All engineering students get six 4-month work terms, where you can learn valuable work experience and earn money at the same time (an average of $50,000 to $90,000 over six work terms). The result is that you leave university with an impressive resume and very little student debt, especially compared to students in the US.    Here is a link for more info about the co-op program.  "
"I am really interested in science, but not so much with math...are there any feilds in science that require limited math?"," I have a pH.D. in microbiology and never was especially good in math.  I did always have an abiding curiosity about the natural world.  Most of the biological sciences do not require huge amounts of higher math to become a practicing scientists.  More math is needed in molecular biology and biochemistry or chemistry, but integrative biology less.  Physics will require a lot of higher math.  The social sciences (sociology, etc.) may require a statistical math, but not much higher than that.  In short, yes, you can have a career in a science that does not require higher math (beyond calculus)    "
"I am really interested in science, but not so much with math...are there any feilds in science that require limited math?","Hi, All of the science programs I know of in college require math.  One of the reasons for that is that the study of math is very useful in training your mind to focus and think logically.  Once people get out of college , for example with an engineering degree, some jobs do require math skills some do not.  If you went into design engineering, math would be involved, if you went into sales engineering , not so much.  Maybe the best thing for you to do is to decide on what type of science ""job"" you would like to have when you graduate form college  and then see how much math is really required in the actual job.  You may find that you can get through your college math courses (which will help to ""train your mind"")  and then go into a field of science that may require some math, but not a lot.  In the mean time, work to do the very best you can in High School w/r to math so you will at least have the option of getting accepted into a college that grants  the science degree of you choice.  Good luck,"
How to not give up on college when you are feeling depressed?," Christi,     You have been dealing with this for at least 2 weeks now, yes, by all means see a counselor! Get help studying. Worse case scenario, consider dropping a class, and finishing in summer, rather than letting your grades take too big of a hit. I wish we were talking in person, so I could have a better feel for what is going on. The thing is, we all get panicky, we all get senioritis, but, in hindsight, graduation did not automatically thrust us into being adults. Many of us took stepping stone jobs - things that helped us to transition to our real careers.  This is not the end all, be all. But, for goodness sakes, do not quit now! You are so close to the finish line you can see it! You are dripping in sweat!       It is really hard for us to counsel you, not really being able to get inside your head (and not being licensed, even if we could....). So yes, please, please, please, talk to someone trained to deal with these issues. You are not the first student facing these concerns!     Kim "
Question for professions at PwC! What is your favorite part of your job and what is the most challenging part?," Hi Madeline - I am a Tax Manager at PwC and have been with the firm for 5 years. My experience has been varied at the firm and I have had the opportunity to travel for work to NYC for a secondment. I worked in the NYC office for 8 months and learned a lot of new technical concepts and built my network.      I think the best part about working at PwC is the networks you form with your colleagues and clients. With any position there are challenges, however leveraging the firm network results in getting our client is the best information.  Tight deadlines always pose a challenge when we are working on a rush job, however the team is always helpful!  "

My favorite part of my day is that every day is different with different projects and team members.    What is the most challenging part of your job?  The most challenging part of my job is with multiple projects occurring at the same time, I sometimes struggle with managing the multiple moving parts.  I find that creating a to do list helps manage this.  How do you honestly feel about your job and your career goals? I feel that my team lets me achieve my goals to the fullest with becoming a CPA while working full time as well as my passion to help the community.

Question for professions at PwC! What is your favorite part of your job and what is the most challenging part?," Hi Madeline,     I just started at PwC in September, so hopefully my answers here are relatable.      What is your favorite part about your job?   - My favorite part is the young atmosphere and energy of the firm. The majority of the firm sits with first years through senior associates (fourth - sixth years), most of which are in their twenties/low thirties. This creates a really fun, energetic culture, at least in Portland.      What is the most challenging part of your job?  - The most challenging part is the travel. For Portland, you will primarily be traveling along the West coast and within the Northwest specifically. However, it is tolerable and can be even  be enjoyable at times to get out of Portland.      How do you honestly feel about your job and your career goals?   - I feel like I am learning a ton in my job and that PwC will set me up very well for the future. It is very busy and challenging, but overall I am enjoying it!      Do you feel satisfied in your life being in the finance industry?   - I would say this is not really applicable to me, unless you consider public accounting ""finance"". They are a bit different, so it is worth looking into the differences between the two and seeing which one you would prefer.       How do you contribute to the better whole of society working the job you do?  - I contribute to the better whole of society by protecting investors. Additionally, I am involved in volunteer events to improve the local community. "
Question for professions at PwC! What is your favorite part of your job and what is the most challenging part?,"Hi Madeline!  Thank you for your questions.  What is your favorite part about your job?  There are many things I like about my job, for example, providing advice on the types of experiences that would enable the person’s growth. Another one that comes to mind is driving best practices that create a positive experience for our people.   What is the most challenging part of your job? Working in a professional services firm certainly comes with it’s own challenges.  As a human capital professional, I get to engage with a wide range of staff and clients each day.  As we work with our clients, both internal and external, it is necessary for us to be agile and flexible not only to their needs but the needs of their business.  Our clients have expectations that we be ahead of the industry and provide our expertise, knowledge and skills so developing relationships quickly and understanding those expectations can be challenging.  But it can also be rewarding when we successfully complete a project or engagement and satisfy their expectations but better grow ourselves.    How do you honestly feel about your job and your career goals? There are many challenging yet rewarding aspects our roles in Human Capital.  For example, it can be difficult to accept limitations to how much you can do to help support others as they have to want it, be willing to work for it, and be agile with changes that happen along the way that may be out of their control.  The rewarding aspect comes from knowing you’ve helped someone find or follow their passion, build a positive brand for themselves, and begin their career path in a successful manner.    Do you feel satisfied in your life being in the finance industry?  I am very happy and satisfied with my job as well as the  industry that I’m in. Some factors include: 1. Passion for area of focus 2. Good working relationships with colleagues 3. Work-life balance 4. Firm values 5. Diversity and inclusion 6. Learning and career development. 7. Challenging work assignments, initiatives and projects.  How do you contribute to the better whole of society working the job you do? PwC’s Purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems.  Working in Human Capital allows me to work with a diverse population of people who have various professional needs.  In my role, I am able to work with these individuals to develop and empower them to grow as professionals.  This allows us to cultivate a diverse pool of talent that can contribute to society not only within our industry but in their respective communities. "
Question for professions at PwC! What is your favorite part of your job and what is the most challenging part?," Hi Madeline!  I would say my favorite part of my job are all of the people I work with.  I am in our Risk Assurance practice in Cleveland and everyone knows each other.  Basically everyone in risk assurance has worked with each other, which is a great way to create relationships with everyone in the practice.  The people I work honestly are the best and I enjoy working with them everyday.     I think the most challenging thing can be working on multiple projects at the same time, especially in risk assurance as you can be working on 1-4 jobs at the same time.  I have worked on writing things down more so I know what I need to work on and create a plan for the day of everything I need to get done.  Trying to stay organized is the key way to help be productive during a busy time period.     As for career goals, I have voiced them from the beginning and local leadership has been willing to work with me to get me on the projects I have wanted to help me grow as a professional.  They have been behind me all the way and are always pushing me to be the best version of myself and I have learned so much since I have been here.     In the Cleveland office, we try to give back whenever possible!  I have been fortunate to be able to mentor a college student who is the first student in her family to go to college, raise money for local educational charities, and teach financial literacy classes for students.  We try to give back as much as we can, whether that is monetary or our time. "
Question for professions at PwC! What is your favorite part of your job and what is the most challenging part?," I love this question and I think everyone has different opinions!     What is your favorite part about your job?  I am in advisory - my favorite part of my job is that my projects and teams are constantly changing. I always find myself working with great people and have been lucky to work for really great clients!     What is the most challenging part of your job?  Same as my favorite! Since my teams are always changing, there is always an adjustment period to get used to the new team structure, different management and working styles, etc.      How do you honestly feel about your job and your career goals?  I think since day one at PwC, I have been able to voice my career goals and partners have been supportive every step of the way. Right now I feel I am in the right place with the right support system. I can not imagine working elsewhere.     Do you feel satisfied in your life being in the finance industry?  I definitely do not feel like I am saving lives, but I do help my clients on a daily basis.      How do you contribute to the better whole of society working the job you do?  I think others mentioned above, but PwC puts a great amount of time and money into encouraging their staff to give back to their community. It is acceptable to take hours or a day away from your client in order to volunteer in the community. I try to fit in volunteer through initiatives at work and through  local initiatives like New York Cares. "
Question for professions at PwC! What is your favorite part of your job and what is the most challenging part?,"  My favorite part of my job is definitely working with such great people. In auditing, teamwork is a big part of having a successful stretch of work so getting along with your coworkers and having time to just joke around and not focus too much on work is important in keeping up the quality of your work as well as your overall happiness level!   The most challenging times are times I put on myself, which are times where I have a problem that I need to solve but I want to solve all on my own. Sometimes it is easy to just ask a superior about your problem and get it solved immediately, but that is no way to truly learn. I like to work out the problem on my own as best I can and then approach my superior with my thought-out solution. If it is wrong, that is no big deal, but putting in the effort is sometimes more important that finding the quick easy answer so you can move on as quick as possible.  "
Question for professions at PwC! What is your favorite part of your job and what is the most challenging part?," Hi Madeline, great questions!     What is your favorite part about your job?   My favorite part is the people I work with. I have  a really supportive team and enjoy working with them!     What is the most challenging part of your job?   I work on projects where I am relying on third parties (not my clients) to provide information to me. It is challenging to keep them engaged and be responsive. Following up with them regularly helps.     How do you honestly feel about your job and your career goals?   Becoming a CPA and working at PwC have been two of the best decisions I have made for my career. Both are extremely well recognized and highly valued in the accounting industry and amongst clients.      Do you feel satisfied in your life being in the finance industry?   Absolutely! I have worked in other industries but I did not feel as satisfied as I do now.     How do you contribute to the better whole of society working the job you do?  PwC invests a lot of resources (time and money) in giving back to society and I am grateful to be a part of it. E.g. I am part of a volunteer team (through Compass) that works on consulting projects for non-profit organizations such as CARIE. We are currently developing a funding strategy for CARIE.  "

How do I know I will get a job after college?,"Jerrod,  I am certain you will get A JOB upon graduating from college, but I think more specifically you want to know if you will get a job in the field you majored in.  You can start by looking at Bureau of Labor Statistics and go to the Occupation Outlook handbook. Look at occupations associated with your major. Then start networking while you are in school. Find out if there is an association on campus that is focused on those occupations (i.e Business club, Nursing association, etc,).  Start networking on and off campus. Talk to the Career Services department at your school and see if they can help you with finding summer internships. Treat your internship like a job. When the internship supervisors see how well you are doing (and you need to well), they may hire you, but in the event that it is not in their budget, you know have credible people in your field who you can use as references. Soak up all the knowledge you can.  In addition, you naturally want to keep your grades and attendance up and seize any opportunities on or off campus that will bring you a step closer to entering your field upon graduation. Start NOW!. Good luck. "
How do I know I will get a job after college?," Hi Jarrod,  Erica has given you some excellent advice.  One additional thought to consider is be open to opportunities that are adjacent to or related to your desired field or job. These opportunities represent a path to broader experience and make you more marketable in the future. And the fact that you can correlate what you learn in ""unrelated"" jobs to a current job opportunity shows that you see the whole picture and have awareness of business or operations. Those skills are highly valuable to the right employer.   "
How do I know I will get a job after college?," I completely agree with Erica and Kim.  To expand upon what Kim said, you may need to find a  istepping stone' job to help you get where you want to be after college.  For instance, there may be a company that you would really like to be your employer but if you have trouble entering the company in a role specifically aligned with your degree, you can find another job at that company that will get your foot in the door.  When you do your very best at that job and build up your reputation within the company, you will be more marketable for your dream job within that company!  That is exactly what I did and I have had opportunities that I never dreamed of! "
How do I know I will get a job after college?," Always have a plan to the plan.  We never know what obstacles or detours life will throw at us, but having a sure plan, staying focused, and being open to change if the need arises will ensure you will end up in career of one of your choices.    I went to college to become an obgyn and after 2 years of college I changed to business and have been working on corporate america.  I was open to change and it worked out for my good.  Best of luck!

Are there any rules of thumb when it comes to student loans?," Hi Shauna,&nbsp; I am glad you are asking this question.&nbsp; Student loans are an investment in yourself and can be a ""good"" debt to get into, assuming your career will allow you to pay off the loans. I would recommend that you only commit to loans that you will be able to pay within 10 years of completing your degree. There are calculators online that will help you to determine a typical salary for your career choice and the cost of your college. "
Are there any rules of thumb when it comes to student loans?," Shauna,     Here is some of the most important things I have learned from working with people to work out strategies to pay back student loans:     1) College is an investment in your future.  Be realistic about the investment you are making in yourself.  How much debt are you planning to take on, and how long will it take you pay to back?   How much money do you expect to earn?  That does not mean you should focus on making the most money.  It just means that doing some homework and being honest with yourself can save you thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars in the long-term.   You are borrowing from your future self, and your future self will thank you for making a good investment!     2) Learn about what loans are available.  There is a ton of different loan options; this is a good starting place to help you learn more:      https://www.salliemae.com/college-planning/student-loans-and-borrowing/     3) You probably know this, but always file a FAFSA form, even if you think you do not qualify.  You might be surprised, and it is free:     https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa     4) When you come to the point of repaying your loans, consider income-driven repayment plans.  These base your student payment on a portion of your income, as opposed to a fixed costs.  However, BE CAREFUL because life events (e.g. raises or bonuses, marriages) and processing requirements (e.g. annual recertification) can drastically affect your payments.     https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven     Additionally, if you are employed by the government or a non-profit, you may qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), which forgives a portion of your loan, without tax consequences,  after 120 payments.     5) Last, but not least, this is complicated.  Do not feel discouraged, even though the resources out there are not particularly helpful.  By even asking this question, you are further ahead than you realize. "

"I want to became a lecturer, so what steps and college would be good for my future?","Hey Azra! Awesome question, I will walk through what some of my professors went through and the different avenues they became professors (I am assuming you want to be a lecturer at a University).  Most of my professors (I am in the engineering school) went through undergrad for the subject they wanted to teach and then did a graduate and PHD degree after. Usually during your graduate degree you have to teach sections and do labs. Even as an undergrad, you can also be a teaching assistant for professors (its a great way to see if you like being a professor). Any college is fine if you want to be a lecturer, I think its actually more important to get published and do research so that you can get into a good college to teach/lecture at.  I am also a student in the business school and most of my professors came from industry (less common in sciences/engineering but I did have a lot of professors who worked in industry for a stint). They had great insight to how the subject they were lecturing about applied to industry which some professors have trouble with communicating if they have never been in industry.  Good luck with your search!"

What is the best way to prepare for studying engineering in graduate school?," Congratulations on being interested in finding the right career to follow.. It takes a special person to enter into a specific career field and meet the demands which that career area presents. The first step is to get to know yourself to see if you share the personality traits which make that make one successful in that area. The next step is doing networking to meet and talk to and possibly shadow people doing what you might think that you want to do to see if this is something that you really want to do, as a career area could look much different on the inside than it looks from the outside.  When I was doing college recruiting, I encountered too many students, who skipped these important steps, and ended up in a career/job for which they were ill suited. "
What is the best way to prepare for studying engineering in graduate school?," Hi Elisabeth!      If you are interested in CN I think doing Neuroscience and CS is a better path. Biomedical is a surprisingly niche degree. A lot of it is about systems with some lab work in higher level courses. Everyone I know (nearly 25-30 people) who did Biomedical are either in consulting or med school. Electrical Engineering, on the other hand, is too low level. You will learn about analog systems, signal processing, semi-conductors, etc. Its not valuable unless you are planning to go in to the industry or deeper into academia it will not complement well with your aspirations to get to Grad school for CN.      CS paired with Neuro will give you a good foundation to think about the future of this space. You could also consider Biomedical if you get into a really good school. Grad schools also care a lot about your GPA - they want to make sure you can survive the Grad curriculum. Research experience will also be really crucial. So find a lab thats doing research that interests you and grow in that role. Good luck!      UT Austin is a solid school for CS and Biomed. I went to Georgia Tech and if you are looking out of state, you should also consider that.  "
How to start looking for Internships?," Hi Dion,   To start looking for an internship, you have to first decide what industry you would like to ultimately pursue a career in to guide you in your search. Once you have that, you should create or adjust your resume to address the experience you may already have in that field. I would recommend including relevant coursework and any summer or on campus jobs you have held.   Once you have your resume, you can go to websites like Internship.com or, if you are interested in working for specific companies, check out their Career websites. Internships are often listed as a normal job posting would be. It may be a little early to apply for Summer Internships, so if you do not see anything yet, do not be discouraged because you may just have to wait a few months.   You can also work through your college--most colleges have a career guidance department that specializes in connecting students with companies in the area. Good luck! "
How to start looking for Internships?," I would recommend going to your college is career service office, and seeing if they have a list of internship programs at organizations that alumni work at. From there, do a little research about the different companies, and chose an organization within a industry that interests you or you want to learn more about. The purpose of internships&nbsp;are to experiment and find out the type of job that you want. &nbsp; "

How do I become an artist?,"Dear Famina, There are many options for employment related to art. I suggest you ask yourself the following: What type of art do I like to do?  What am I good at? Do I like to work alone or with others? Do I want to help others directly through my art or just create and get paid? Am I drawn to visual art by hand or computer? The following are examples of different career options you might consider: art therapist illustrator designer teacher free lance artist display work You might google each of these to get a better idea of what the position involves and what is expected. You might also volunteer to assist at a variety of businesses to see first hand and talk to others about their work and what they like or do not like about it.  Not knowing how old you are, I am not sure what is appropriate for you at your current age but you can do research and try different things before being hired so you have a better idea of what to go to school for in college, if that is what will help you move forward in a career.  Good luck, art is a wonderful way to fulfill your creative soul and express your inner self while bringing beauty to the lives of others. "

Are there any resume items which would make my college application really stand out?,
Of what importance is the university of a student if he wants to get a good job ??," Great question.  I would say that no matter what school you go to and what your degree is in, there are always options in life.  The only challenge is that when you switch, you essentially have to ""start over"" to a some degree(depending on how dramatically different the career change is).     Here is my story...I went to school to get my liberal studies degree not sure if I would want to eventually get into education or law.  After college and before grad school I tried out the corporate world then fell into the recruiting field.  I decided to go into education and taught 6 years, and a few years back decided to revisit the corporate world.  Has the switch set me back a few years?  Sure.  But, was the career transition worth it because I am happy?  Absolutely.     Essentially, anything is doable with the right attitude, work ethic, and determination.   "
Of what importance is the university of a student if he wants to get a good job ??," Hi Yash - good questions! The selection of a university is very important. People often talk about ""the right fit"" when selecting a college or university. Some important questions to ask are: i) does this school have the major or majors I am interested in? ii) how far away is it from home? iii) where are students getting hired when they graduate from a given school or program? Notice I did not say anything about rank or cost... iv) are these places I would like to work? Having ""the right fit"" will help you adjust to university life, find activities and friends that you enjoy, and provide you with the training and education you need for a career.    As to your second question... I would like to share my personal experience. I studied chemical engineering at UMass Amherst, but when I graduated I worked from Microsoft doing software testing on the Windows 7 project. While this is not a common path, its certainly possible to change your career after completing an engineering degree IF you pick up skills that are transferable. Switching from EC to CS or IT sounds like a much easier switch to me, though you would probably have to get some internships or extra training to demonstrate you are the right person for the job.    I hope this help and good luck!  Matt P. Boston, MA "

I was a media planner and buyer which is taking a client is budget and planning where it makes the most sense for their advertising message to live to deliver to their target and meet their goals.  This includes buying media space across different vehicles including broadcast.  I am not sure if this is an approach you are interested in but there are many ways to achieve this career.  The University of Texas has a specific advertising and media program, but other colleges typically offer advertising specific classes in their marketing programs.  I would recommend a decent amount of math classes as the position is focused around financial planning."

How hard are Engineering classes in college?," Engineering is certainly not the easiest major because of the math and science requirements. Within the engineering curriculum, chemical engineering is more challenging (with calculus and reaction rates etc.) than Civil or Industrial engineering which work more with algebra, geometry and trigonometry.  There is a lot to learn and there is a fair amount of homework and practice required.  To that end, all engineering fields offer a very diverse and rewarding career and is worth the effort that it takes to get a degree.  I was only an average high school student and received a BS in mechanical engineering through night school as I worked.  I would recommend going full time to a state school with an engineering program. Good luck.  "
How hard are Engineering classes in college?," Hello, Clayton:  You appear to be interested in engine mechanics and possibly mechanical engineering. These are two different professions. To become an engine mechanic you typically attend a year or two of mechanics school (perhaps at a Community College) after you graduate high school. You would then work on repairing vehicle engines, usually in a commercial garage. While the hourly rate of an EXPERIENCED mechanic can be fairly good, you are unlikely to approach anything like $100,000 per year.     To become a mechanical engineer, you would attend a 4-year college and graduate with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. To get into an engineering school, you will want to take four years of Math in High School, along with Physics and Chemistry. The engineering courses in college will definitely be challenging and will require your full commitment. Having said that, a degree in engineering can be a very interesting and rewarding experience for you if you are prepared to work. After graduating, you would typically work in a professional engineering office DESIGNING mechanical systems of all sorts. If you were interested in designing engines, you would probably want to work with a vehicle manufacturer such as Ford, GM, Freightliner or Peterbuilt. Right out of college you could expect to make perhaps $50,000$60,000/yr. A successful Mechanical Engineer could expect to achieve $100,000/year after perhaps 15-20 years in the Field.  I hope this gives you some perspective and I wish you well in school.     Pete Sturtevant, PE "
What are the normal work conditions (excludingthing likes weather and other changing variables)?," If I am interpreting this question correctly, you are asking about work conditions for carpenters.  The thing you have to know is that carpentry covers everything from large construction projects to cabinetry to custom artwork.  Because of that, the work conditions range from begin outside putting huge structure together to making fine artwork in wood indoors.  And in the near future, computer aided design and manufacturing and rapid prototyping will get more and more pervasive.  Very soon, you will not be able to avoid using computers and a whole host of automated manufacturing techniques.  But while you can likely get a job as an unskilled laborer and then work your way up, I would recommend taking advantage of training programs.  The biggest mistake I see many young people make is thinking that ""book learning"" and being a college student are the only ways to go.  One thing we must never lose is the ability to apply our knowledge and theories.  The artisans of the past knew this, and would require people to be apprentices first.  And the greatest craftsmen -- artists, carpenters, mechanics, electricians, plumbers, engineers and, I think, the best scientists and general problem solvers go in and get their ""hands dirty"".  I have a dentist who is, as far as I can tell, the best I have ever had.  His secret?  He knows how to do bodywork on cars.  Craft is craft.  It is what makes humans tick. "

What career would suite my interests?," Hi Dayne, excellent question.  I think a lot people are wondering the same thing!  Growing up, I was interested in the arts and media.  I thought I would eventually end up in a creative field so I tried out a summer internship at a media production company.  While it was a great experience and I loved working there, I could not see myself in media for the rest of my career.  By trying it out, I realized my interest in film and media was better left as a hobby rather than a career.  While I was in school, I also worked part time at a small accounting office and really liked what I did and was able to see myself doing that kind of work in the long run.  I now work in public accounting and am still enjoying what I do--it suits my personality and skill sets well, and I find myself being challenged in positive ways.  My advice to you is to speak to professionals in the fields you are interested in, and possibly even shadow them for a day, or work for a few weeks to assess if you would actually enjoy that type of career.  Doing research on different career paths or studying the paths to success of people you look up to will help you to make an informed decision.  I have also come to learn that your interests may change and develop over time.  I certainly would have never thought I would be passionate about audit and the insurance industry when I was in school, but here I am enjoying my line of work!  My advice is to look for a career that will give you opportunities and the flexibility to grow and change.   Think about the skills and experiences you will gain, rather than simply the day-to-day tasks.  Good luck! "
What career would suite my interests?,"Try answering  this question: If I had all the education, experience, finances and contacts I needed, and I could pursue any career I wanted, and I absolutely could not fail, what would I do? If you can answer this question, maybe that is a good direction to start towards.  I think I once held the job your looking for...VP of International Travel Catering for an international trade association."
What career would suite my interests?,You have a lot of interests and a lot of goals. I would look in to project management or implementation...this can provide that travel.
What career would suite my interests?," Hi Dayne, you asked a very good question and I think can pose challenges to many throughout their lives. What do I do with so many interests? How can I focus? In particular, what can I do for money? Unfortunately, for many years I did not truly have a good handle on pursuing a career path right for me so I am trying to direct you away from my personal mistakes. I do not know with you being in South Africa if you have ever heard this saying but it goes like this: ""&lt;span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""&gt;The best-laid&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; plans of mice and men &lt;span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""&gt;&nbsp;often go awry."" With mice and men this may be true. It is definitely true for men but for mice...I do not know.  I followed the path of men for many years. Anyhow, I raise to your attention this phrase because I know of someone who can give better results. I will tell you who that someone is first. Then I will comment on some of the things that other people have responded to about your question. The one who can fill your heart with joy is the Lord and He brings true satisfaction. More than just a paycheck, your question eluded to, ""How can I gain satisfaction?""  There is a Bible verse that goes like this, ""Delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart."" Do you listen to uplifting Christian music and sing songs to delight yourself in the Lord? Another Bible verse is: ""Trust in the Lord with all of your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will direct your paths."" With the Lord, you will not suffer ""the best laid plans going awry"".  As to what the others who commented on your question responded with, I would give further considerations of what they said with great prayer. One person mentioned hobbies but did not encourage you to start out or maintain some of them as hobbies for now.  You can easily cook as a hobby, improve your cooking techniques, dabble with new recipes, adjust your tastes, adapt certain recipes to see if you can improve them, try new spices, etc.  Cook is something you have to do by choice as you said money is a concern of yours too and not just an interest. Who knows, by becoming a better cook, you may further define you tastes for certain foods, like Asian food, Mexican food, Italian food, etc. What other interests do you now have that might be better as hobbies for the short-run or long-run in the future? If you absolutely without question want all of them as a career, do consider the career fields mentioned by the other people who responded to your question, especially Donald Knapik. No matter what, it sounds like you will ultimately have to specialize in something to pursue all of your interests in one career. At your age, think of building blocks if you must in your career choices to ultimately try to get where you want to go. Become a planner if you are not one already. What are your daily plans, weekly plans, monthly plans, yearly plans or further?  Planning will allow you to keep a focus and potentially think in terms of building blocks required to become successful. We can not all do everything at once! As for pursuing further education. I would pursue a degree that allows you to do as many independent studies if you can and choose schooling you may need based upon it. You may have to name your own degree. I know cost is a factor but see what you can discover through looking at different schools first. You may be surprised at what you find.  No matter what enjoy the Lord and the journey of your life that can be held to the near right hand of the Lord.  Here is another verse for you and I leave you with it before giving you next steps: &lt;/span&gt;Psalm 16:11&nbsp;(English Standard Version (ESV) of the Bible,   11&nbsp;   You make known to me&nbsp;the path of life;  &lt;span class=""ql-font-monospace""&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;in your presence there is&nbsp;fullness of joy;  &lt;span class=""ql-font-monospace""&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;at your right hand are&nbsp;pleasures forevermore.&lt;span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""&gt; &lt;/span&gt; "

what is the suggested education for special victims detective?, Specific requirements needed to be a detective aside from education. 
what is the suggested education for special victims detective?," Maryjane,  Great question! During my time as a detective I have met many investigators with different educational backgrounds, from music to government degrees. In my experience there is no one degree that would lend itself exclusively to criminal justice or special victims. While having a criminal justice degree helps a lot of this will be covered in whatever academy you attend. In my opinion some of the best detectives I have ever met were just naturally nosey people. If I had to point to one thing it would be having great people skills and that’s not a degree . Being able to talk to victims and suspects is key to solving cases. You can’t do this if you do the cliche TV tough cop routine, it just doesn’t work like that. My advice is that if you want to join law enforcement is to get a degree that interests you. What makes law enforcement great is having so many people with different educational backgrounds that help solve complex problems.  "
How achievable is it to open up my own architecture firm?," It is quite achievable.  It also depends on what kind of architecture you plan on doing.  For single family residential and up to 5 units, you do not need a license.  If you plan on doing more than 5 unit housing and commercial work, you will need your license.  What state are you in?  There are a few states that require additional testing for the area.  California is one of them.  There is also something called the intern development program where you track areas you need to work in to be able to start taking your exams.  Its been over 10 years since I started my journey, so you will need to check to see how much school and work is required before you are eligible to start taking your exams.  The intern development program will have you exposed to a firm and the process of getting a project from design to construction.  You are taught the project management required for this.  BUT owning your own firm has business related to it.  Being business savvy is a HUGE plus because schools do not really teach this at all.  I worked for a coworker who went out on his own after working in firms for 7+ years or so.  A lot of time and late nights were definitely a part of his work day.  I left his firm after 5 years and its been almost 8 and he is  up to 5-7 people in his firm now.  It is achievable!  "
How powerful is LinkedIn ?," This is a great question and I am so glad you are asking because there is lots of confusion about LinkedIn. As a recruiter with over 15 years of experience I have reviewed thousands of resumes and have used LinkedIn to find candidates since their beginning.   A resume and a LinkedIn profile are both extremely important and will contain a lot of the same information. However, they have different purposes. Your LinkedIn profile allows you to be found by hiring managers, recruiters and other professionals looking to network with you. Think about your LinkedIn profile as your ""always on"" professional career advertisement. Hiring managers and recruiters are searching LinkedIn day and night seeking individuals with the right skill set, education and experience to join their teams. Make sure your LinkedIn profile is up-to-date, free of typos and grammatical errors and remember your profile should not just be a laundry list of what you have done at each company. It should clearly state your professional value proposition and highlight your achievements in each position you list. Every LinkedIn profile should include a pleasant-professional looking head shot for a picture. Save pictures with your friends, family and pets for Facebook and Instagram. This should be a picture of you dressed in work appropriate attire and grooming from shoulders up with a simple uncluttered background.   Your resume, just as important as your LinkedIn profile, will be used when you want to apply for a job. I think of a resume more like your business card for career search. Your resume must be professional, free of typos and grammatical errors (just like your LinkedIn profile) and again, it should not just be a laundry list of what you have done at each company. It should clearly state your professional value proposition or PVP -What is the value you can bring to an employer? (The PVP has replaced the old ""Objective"" used on resumes) and highlight your achievements in each position you list. Make an effort to quantify your achievements wherever possible and keep it clear and concise. A recruiter or hiring manager will only review a resume for a few seconds before they move on to the next. Make sure your resume is representing you in the best and most professional way possible so you receive that follow up email or call. "
How powerful is LinkedIn ?," Hi, Excellent question, besides the common uses of posting your resume and having your experience on LinkedIn...it can be good for a lot of other uses such as networking and finding other people within your industry or career field.  Also, following organizations and groups that you are interested in can lead to possible job opportunities and it is a great place to network with other people and keep up with current business/industry news. Good luck! "
How powerful is LinkedIn ?," Recruiters use LinkedIn as a tool to find candidates for their vacant positions, so LinkedIn is powerful for both job seekers and recruiters. I recommend having a resume that closely matches your Linkedin profile. LinkedIn will help you get noticed and contacted by recruiters and your resume will be used once you land an interview. Your resume will be used by the various interviewers you will encounter. As it was previously mentioned, having a digital presence is a must, but make it a professional presence by presenting a professional looking headshot and profile. LinkedIn is not Facebook, so keep it business focused and keep it professional looking.  Good Luck ! "
How powerful is LinkedIn ?," LinkedIn will help you identify new opportunities at companies and identify connections through your network, but your resume will be your support as a strong candidate.  Think about Linkedin as a door opener but once the door opens you need to provide them with your case.  Your LinkedIn network is only as strong as your network, so make sure that make those connections! "
How powerful is LinkedIn ?, You have to work hard on your resume and LinkedIn profile. Having a digital presence nowadays is essential. 
How should I prepare myself for my job search as I go into my senior year of college?," The most important thing that you can do is to get to know yourself well enough to determine a career focus and meet people who are doing what you think that you want to do, so that you can see the inside view of careers.  Starting as soon as possible will enable you to take the right courses and make connections that could help you not only to determine appropriate career areas but put you in line for shadowing and internships and part time jobs and other career exposure related  opportunities.     Getting to know yourself and how your personality traits relate to people involved in various career opportunities is very important in your decision making process. During my many years in Human Resources and College Recruiting, I ran across too many students who had skipped this very important step and ended up in a job situation which for which they were not well suited. Selecting a career area is like buying a pair of shoes. First you have to be properly fitted for the correct size, and then you need to try on and walk in the various shoe options to determine which is fits the best and is most comfortable for you to wear. Following are some important steps which I developed during my career which have been helpful to many .    "
"How important is travel to becoming educated, intellectual and well- rounded?"," I do think that travelling is very helpful to becoming well-rounded and educated.  Travel opens you up to different cultures, allowing you to compare your culture with that of others; educating you about people and places beyond your own that will help inform everything you do in your life; opening you up to new ideas, presented in new and different ways; and educating you about history, commerce, culture, language, and the arts that you will use for years to come.  Most important, you learn much about yourself when you travel: how well you adapt to new situations, where your strengths and weaknesses lie and how to improve them, how strong your social skills are, an understanding of how empathetic and curious you are -- excellent traits in working with others.  If you  are required to learn a language in school, traveling to a country where they speak that language - and where you submerge yourself in that language and its culture -- will enhance your ability to  speak and think in that language, cementing it into your brain if you continue to use it upon return from your trip.  Also, studying abroad for a semester or longer opens you up to enhanced education.  And, one of the best pluses of travel is that of making friends around the world - and, now, in this connected world, they can be friends for life.  "

"How important is travel to becoming educated, intellectual and well- rounded?"," I think you must be very observant, Emily.  I have led photography tours for nearly four decades.

You can carry on conversations with people that you may not have been able to without the knowledge you gained from travel. I do not think it is a necessity, but it definitely helps. People who have not traveled can often feel like they live in a bubble -- that their life is very insulated. Getting out of your comfort zone, eating new foods, learning new languages, understanding how different people live, witnessing extreme poverty -- it all changes you as a person.

How can I ensure that the major that I pick now ( and am passionate about) will be relevant after 4 years?,"Cerrlin, there is no guarantee. As you know, technology is constantly changing therefore we must all keep learning about new technologies. If you are passionate about something in particular you should keep focusing on that because that passion will keep you interested.  Technology is touching just about everything these days so whatever it is you are currently considering to major in keep an eye on possible links to technology because I do think it will at some point be affected by technology.

How can I ensure that the major that I pick now ( and am passionate about) will be relevant after 4 years?,"Any education is a valuable resource, even those that have become irrelevant has something to teach you. Sit down with your guidance counselor or one at the college and make choices that can be used in multiple fields. Mathematics, Science, Psychology all can be used in multiple fields of study.  Start taking your general courses then chose. You do not have to chose today and you can always adjust your courses if you change your mind."
How can I ensure that the major that I pick now ( and am passionate about) will be relevant after 4 years?,"Unfortunately you do not.

How can I ensure that the major that I pick now ( and am passionate about) will be relevant after 4 years?,"You can not.  Flexibility is the key.

Do I need to go to college to have a successful career?," Hi there,   I applaud you for thinking ahead as cost for higher education has soared in recent years! I agree with the others that responded to your question, and I think you are on the right track trying to balance the cost to benefits. I worked in the student loan industry and know first hand how important it is to have a career plan in place or at least a passion identified prior to borrowing too much money. Depending upon your goals, think about related careers and whether or not higher education is for you. Some ways to cut costs are trying community college in your first and second years if you are not sure, and you can always transfer to a more expensive school after one or two years that has a strong program in the field chosen if you wish. Work/study programs are doable too to mitigate expenses. There are lots of options, but the first important step is to decide your passion, and then take it one step at a time.    Best wishes! "
Do I need to go to college to have a successful career?," HI,    It is always nice to aim high and work harder for it in life. However if you are going through times when being able to afford college education is a question, then you can always choose to work part time and study or work for money (save enough for college) and then go back to college.   During their high school career, students may begin to question the importance of a college education. They might find themselves asking, “Why is it important to go to college?” The answer is that, more than ever, attending college provides opportunities for graduates which are not as widespread to those who have not received a higher education.   For many high school students, being able to immediately generate an income after graduation is an appealing thought. They may also be repelled by the rising cost of tuition, and while it is true that a higher education may be one of the largest expenses you will ever face, the importance of a college education has become quite evident in terms of earning potential within today’s economy.   Decide what best works for your and do your best at it.   All the best! "
Do I need to go to college to have a successful career?," Hi there,  Interesting question. The short answer here is no. There are several career paths that you can take that do not necessarily require that you have a college degree; however, statistics show that college graduates consistently out earn individuals without degrees. Additionally, many top level companies look for applicants with degrees as they possess certain skills one generally would obtain during higher level education (e.g. critical thinking and problem solving skills).  This really depends on your goals and what career path you would like pursue. If you are wanting to work on old cars an atypical college degree program may not be beneficial. However, if you dream of being a top level business executive or opening your own business certain degrees would be very helpful.  The take away here would be to think about what your goals are and then decide what you want to do based on those goals. Best of luck! "
Do I need to go to college to have a successful career?," Very thoughtful question.  I went to college and my other siblings did not.  I would say we are all equally successful.  One sibling learned a trade and the other used natural skills to gain employment.  The important thing to remember is that college is not just for young adults, you can go at any age.  My spouse went to college at age 30.  The critical part is that you are ready to go to college and have an idea of what you would like to study.  Sometimes it takes a while to discover passions and sometimes those passions change over time so even if you go to college right out of high school you may go back to college later to study something completely different.  You can always start by taking one class at a local community college and see how you feel about college at this point in your life.  Community college can also be a great place to discover what you would like to study.  Good Luck!   "

What does a recruiter for a fashion/retail company look for in entry level candidates?," Hi Stacy!   There are a number of things you can do to put yourself in the best position possible for a career in fashion.   First- which area in fashion do you want to work in?  Design, sales, marketing, advertising, buying, pattern making; etc?  Fashion is a wide and complex industry with many parts.  Before determining what you should do to get there; figure out where you want to go.   Based on your goal- the next step is to declare a major that will allow you to be prepared for that role.  Example:  If you want to be a Fashion Designer, you want to have a major or courses in fashion design (of course), pattern-making, textiles, auto-cad, graphics, and other arts.  If you want to be in on the business side of things- majors or courses in marketing, advertising, corporate communications, finance, and management would be best.   Third, as a student- you want to make sure you have at least one internship under your belt by the time you graduate.  Whether a short-term summer internship, or a internship that is long-term throughout the year- find one that is inline with where you want to be.  If you are lucky, you may find an internship that pays.  However, what should matter in the quality of the experience and the company.     Find a part-time job in the fashion world.  Even a job a Sales Associate at a store in your local mall will provide you with first-hand experience in the industry that can build your experience from the ground up, and show where you want to be.   Nothing beats learning first hand.   Lastly, join student organizations.  Fashion and arts clubs is where you want to be.  If one at your school does not exist, make your own!  Employers love candidates who take on initiative and leadership roles. "

"I want to study law but not sure what subjects need to be taken,so need some advice on that.","While I do not have any experience with South African Barristers,  I would suggest you give some thought to what kind of law you would like to practice.   If you are more introverted and do not want to be heavily involved with client interactions,   then you should think about research as a focus area,  or if you love the stage, you may want to get more involved in trial law.   on the other hand,  you may find that you like keeping things on track and orderly, therefore corporate law may be a good fit or if you are wanting to focus more on criminal justice, then you could lean toward defense law or becoming a prosecutor.      The main point here is to do some self analysis and try to align yourself to a few different good options for you.   With that,  you will be better positioned to find a law school that is aligned to your focus areas and from there you will be able to better decipher the kind of course work preferred by that law school.     good luck"

"I want to study law but not sure what subjects need to be taken,so need some advice on that.","Hi, Sithelo:  good that you are thinking about this now.

In general, most law schools require a well-rounded liberal arts course of study.  Most of all they look for top-notch grades, great letters of recommendation and a good score on the LSAT.

What majors do you recommend in order to be an ethnomusicologist?," Hi Alexandra,   Many Ethnomusicology programs, including the one at Penn (which is very highly regarded) require an Anthropology background, along with music. Depending what school is program you ultimately enter, you will likely have to have completed at least some coursework in Cultural Anthropology, Linguistics, and possibly classes related to one or more specific cultures. You may need to complete a minor in the field, or even a full degree program. The same will likely go for music - at least courses in Music Theory and Music History, and possibly performance requirements as well. A double major or double degree in Music and Anthropology is certainly worth considering.   Your best bet is to look into the best Ethno grad programs - Penn, Stanford, and Florida State are a good start - and see what their requirements are. That will point the way. And do not be afraid to call or email the department head at any school you might be interested in attending; they will give you the best guidance.   Best of luck! B.J. "

How can I avoid taking out loans?," Scholarships (outside the university and at the university).  There are so many available scholarships at the university of your choosing that students end up no taking advantage of.  Why?  Because they did not know it existed.  You just have to know how to find them (visit your financial office).   Work study programs at your school.   Internships/Co-ops Programs   Also, when you do apply for financial aid, and your school gives you a residual check, DO NOT spend it.  Please get with a financial advisor who can instruct you where to put that money (mutal fund, etc).  This way YOU are making money off of it and when you graduate you do not have that extra debit looming over your head.   I hope this helps!  Good luck on everything :)!! "

How long does it usually take to get into a job after graduating college?," I have read and heard that it is been difficult for recent graduates to find jobs, so my advice is to start now and pursue every opportunity.  The more people you network with, the better.  There are some basics To Do is such as creating a LinkedIn Profile and building out your network, attending conferences in industries your pursuing, and volunteering at a nonprofit to add to your experience and resume.  When you find a job your interested in, go to the ""advance search"" in at LinkedIn as it is powerful tool to identify people you may know with the company.  Good luck, and keep at it! "
How long does it usually take to get into a job after graduating college?," It really depends on what you are willing to do. You can get a ""job"" anywhere, but are you willing to get some experience outside of your field. Ideally, you want to land your dream job right out of college but this does not happen for everyone. Be willing to take a job outside of what you consider ""perfect"" and get some real world experience, and try to pick something that will help you in your ""dream"" job. For example, if you want to be Sales manager, consider a job in finance so you can understand how the logistics work on the backend, or if you want to own your own business consider working for a startup so you can learn what you would be working with beforehand. Do not be afraid to do a job (for a limited amount of time) that is not perfect, that can help you in your long term goals. Consider it like an apprenticeship or externship. It helps! "
How long does it usually take to get into a job after graduating college?," Finding a job can take time, but it is time well spent. If I learned anything after college it was that it is important to find the right job, not just any job. Something to keep in mind is that nothing is permanent. Experience in any form is a good, and always something you can build off of to get to where you want to go. If you focus on finding the ""perfect"" job, you might be missing a great opportunity. Keep an open mind, and remember that you will not love every aspect of a job, but if you can find something you are passionate about you are on the right track. No matter what role you are in, there will always be less glamorous aspects. Internships and networking are a great way to get your foot in the door without committing to a full-time gig. Talk to people about their career path in the field you want to work in as this is extremely helpful when figuring out what your next move will be.  "
How long does it usually take to get into a job after graduating college?," Hi Lexis, Following on from the comments below, it really depends on what you are going for.

Whereas, I decided to move country and found a job immediately. It was not my dream job but it got me experience and I was able to progress faster from there. Figure out what what you want to achieve and stay open minded! Best of luck! PS: Look up #7FirstJobs on Twitter for some inspiration :) #7firstjobs "
How long does it usually take to get into a job after graduating college?," The job search varies for each person. For me, it was about four months -- and during that four months I was sending out around four or five resumes with custom cover letters each day. While I was looking, I got a part-time job in my field of interest, which was a great way for me to reach out to previous contacts and let them know I have an updated resume and to check in with them on possible opening. The job hunt can be stressful and tough -- there will be positions you apply to that you never hear back from one way or the other. Keep your spirits up because you will get a job! Always stay positive!   The BIGGEST piece of advice is to be prepared for your interviews. Research the company and be familiar with what they do -- are they on social media? who makes up the leadership team there? what do you like about what they do? what would you bring to the company? Check online for sample interview questions and practice!    Good luck!! "
How long does it usually take to get into a job after graduating college?," Hey Lexis,   Great question. I was pondered with the same question when I was in college.

So I took on freelance jobs, I interned at a few places and before I was done with my senior year, I landed a job at an ad agency. It is a great way to sharpen your skills, get work experience, and references for future jobs. Let me know if you need any specific examples, hope this helps.   Dream big, Vivian "
Will my dream career (Medical Social Worker) be enough to get me by financially?," Hi Michael,      I am a firm believer in studying what you love and the money tends to work it is way out.  That being said, Social Work is not one of the higher paying fields.  The more education you have and training, the higher salary you can command.  For example, if you have a master is degree in social work are a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, you will earn more money than a social workers with only a bachelor is degree.  The bigger the hospital and bigger city it is located in, usually the higher the salary.  If you earn your LCSW, you can go into private practice and supplement your income.       Good Luck!

What is the day-to-day routine of a court judge or justice?," Well, it sort of depends on what level of judge you are talking about.  Let is take it down to a district court judge at the county level.   Given that the vast majority of cases never go to trial, a lot of the judge is time is spent reviewing documents: various motions filed by the lawyers for the parties, and making rulings on these motions. Some are easy. A lawyer wants a delay in a case because he is scheduled to be in trial in another court that day. Some are difficult. Motion for Summary Judgement, for example. This is a very long legal document, citing numerous other cases as justification to dismiss a case for some reason or another.   Sometimes the judge has docket call. This might be first appearances for parties accused of a crime, or those for who a motion to revoke probation has been filed. He will hear the defendant make a plea, and set the bond, or, remand without bond.   Divorce cases, child abuse cases, and juvenile law cases can be very emotional. The judge has to apply the law, regardless of personal feelings.   Judges of course also have time to visit. But really, it is a lot of reading and writing.   Unless, you are on the supreme court or an appellate court. In which case, see the answer above! Kim "
What is the day-to-day routine of a court judge or justice?," Associate Justice Lawrence Order arrives at work at 8 or 9 in the morning and meets with his clerks, who have been carefully chosen based on their law school accomplishments as well as on their lockstep agreement with his judicial views. As on most days, the first order of business is digging through the never-ending pile of applications for the court to hear cases. One hundred and fifty of these cases are reviewed each week.   Today is first case is Jones v. Mississippi. Lawyers representing Jones argue that Mississippi is malfunctioning electric chair, commonly known as ""Sparky,"" botched his execution, setting his hair on fire and preventing him from going to heaven to spend blissful eternity with his dead relatives. The lawyers argue that this is a violation of the Eight Amendment to the Constitution which prohibits ""cruel and unusual punishment."" This case has made its way up through the court system, with both sides losing and then successfully appealing, so it appears to be the sort of legal quandary the Supreme Court might want to resolve.   Although most cases presented to the Court are never heard, this one seems like a good candidate. The Court has gone back and forth on capital punishment, banning it entirely on Eighth Amendment grounds in the 1970s, and then reversing that decision a few years later. This case could result in a number of outcomes: allowing Mississippi to continue using ""Sparky,"" banning the use of electric chairs and enforcing stricter rules for executions to ensure minimal suffering for the condemned, or even banning capital punishment entirely. Bet they are wishing they had a three-sided coin right about now.   Justice Order and his clerks have already read the case, and they engage in a spirited discussion about it. After all, what is cruel and unusual punishment? Does it have to be both cruel and unusual to qualify, or will one of the two suffice? Since Justice Order is an ""originalist,"" meaning he attempts to interpret the Constitution exactly how he believes the founders meant it when it was written, he ponders what James Madison would have considered cruel and unusual. Aside from being the target of ""short"" jokes.   Ultimately, Justice Order decides the case should be heard, since this is a good opportunity to set a clear precedent. If three other justices agree with him, Jones v. Mississippi will appear on the Court is docket in a few months.   After going over a few more cases, none of which meet Justice Order is strict standards, it’s time to break for lunch. As with most of the justices, Justice Order usually lunches with his clerks, a group of bright, talented young men and women to whom he is something of a father figure. At lunch, he discusses his love of big-game hunting and his hatred of communism. The clerks nod repeatedly. Oh, how he loves his yes men.   The afternoon schedule consists of conference, which is when the justices sit around a table and take turns opining about a case that was recently argued. Today is case is Woe v. Rade, which the justices all agree bears an uncanny similarity to some case about abortion from a while ago. Woe argues a constitutional right to an abortion, which Justice Order and his more conservative colleagues feel is ridiculous. ""It never mentions a right to abortion once in the Constitution!"" Justice Order argues at one point.   However, left-leaning Justice Peace man believes that the Constitution is a ""living document"" that should be interpreted broadly within the context of the changing times. She also thinks it should be fed three square meals and watered twice daily. She might be taking her position a bit too literally.   She argues that there is an inherent right to privacy in the Constitution and that an appropriate modern interpretation would protect abortion rights.   The swing vote seems to be Justice Look at me, who is always the swing vote. Yep, he is a real swinger. Justice Look at me gives a long sweeping speech that nobody understands, finally declaring that ""Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt."" A couple of hours later, the justices discover that he has voted in favor of Woe, affirming access to abortion as a fundamental right. This stance mirrors the Court is decision in Roe v. Wade, the old case the justices could not quite remember, so they appear consistent, which is important for the Court is image. The ""bad boy"" image they were going for a few years back did not really take. "

I came across an article on the america.edu website that offered a list of the top 20 criminal justice programs offered through colleges in the U.S. Of those listed, the top 5 are as follows: University of Pennsylvania (Ivy League, most selective), Northeastern University, University of Florida, University of Missouri (St. Louis campus), and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (Newark campus). Luckily for you, some of those appear to be located around the Boston area. I will post the link to the website in the references below. Please bear in mind that many websites (even educational ones like the one I referenced) will have differing lists that are not definitive. I hope this information helps to answer your question. If you have any further inquiries, please feel free to post them here. As always, thank you for using Career Village!   References:   Top 20 Criminal Justice Programs In America. (n.d.). America.edu.

Is it possible to be accepted into medical school without being a science major?," I know a few people who took the exact route you are thinking - music undergrad, leading to Medical school - and are now doctors (that are still active performers on the side). I do not know if it is still true, but at one time, music majors had the highest medical school acceptance rates (percent, not total number) of any undergraduate degree for exactly the reasons you stated above. Music is one of the most demanding courses of study at the college level, and admissions officers know that.   Sounds like a great plan!   Best of luck! "
If you are a nurse can you make your own schedule?," Good question!  The answer is not black and white unfortunately though. It depends on where you work and what area of nursing you choose. For example, if you choose a hospital job with shift work, you are normally hired in for a usual shift. Most shifts in hospital nursing are 12 hour shifts, but there are still 8, 10 and Weekend option only shifts.  You would also get additional pay for working evening, nights, or weekend shifts.  Keep in mind if you have a higher than usual number of patients admitted,  or a co- worker calls in ill, if another nurse can’t be found a Nurse would have to stay over.  This does give you a power of negotiation sometimes and we can be creative with this...such as, “I will work another 8 hours if I can be off on Friday.”   In a free-standing surgery center that performs elective surgeries you normally have daytime hours.  OR in the hospitals, you have set hours, but if cases are running long, you will have to stay over.  Also for emergency cases, surgery nurses take turns being on call, for which you Re compensated a bit and higher pay if you get called in for a case. Home Care is somewhat similar.  If you work in administration, Education or Infection Control, those hours are normal daytime hours usually.  Doctor’s offices normally close on time.  There is always plenty of overtime pay to be made. If you need a shift off and the schedule is already posted, you likely can get off if you work out a trade with your co-worker.  So, we are flexible, especially if you help others out, they are more apt to help you out.  However, we have to keep our patients safe as we can first and foremost. Your next steps would be to think about what kind of nursing YOU want to practice.  When I was a new single Nurse without children I could work ER, evenings and nights and lots of hours.  After I became more experienced in my practice , married and had children, I got into Nursing Administration as a Department Manager so I could better manage my schedule and be home with my family at the traditional times...however, one must remember that all shifts should see their manager sometimes as well.  Work a late evening and begin night shift or go in early to see night staff and leave early from day shift.  Flexible! Good luck in your journey!  "
If I were to become a bio engineer what kind of jobs would be available? Could I work in a hospital and still make a lot of money?,"As with previous answers, the choice is yours.  Begin college with a double major in biology/pre-med and mechanical engineering.  You will be VERY busy, so do not plan on leading the cheerleading squad.  While you are in school, try to locate bioengineering firms where you could intern.  This will help you get connected to those who do the hiring.  Study hard, but retain imagination.

When is the best time to change my major?," Hey Rachel, it is best to have your major figured out by the end of your sophomore year / beginning of your junior year. Many students change their major, so do not sweat it. You will be taking basics / required coursework in years one and two. You will also have some electives -- this is a great time to take different classes you are interested in to see what you really find interesting, and can see yourself doing in the future.

What should I expect by majoring in Biology?,"Biology is not a career where you are going to get rich and there are often little victories sprinkled in with serious crushing defeats.  If your only concern is not wasting someones money, a degree in finance or business might be the right track.  If you however want a career filled with asking questions and trying to discover what is happening in this world, biology is probably a good fit. If you are on the fence about studying biology there are two things you can do. 1. Take an introductory biology class (most universities require it anyway) and see if you are inspired. 2. Do not study biology.  If you are not passionate about it do not waste the next 40 years of your life doing it.   I love what I do but most people are not remotely interested in it and I do not impress people at dinner parties."

How to keep confidence to study?," Ena,   Studying can be taxing on both your mind and your time.  Here is a few things that worked for me:   -Schedule your time:  Research has shown that our brains focus best for about one and a half hours before needing a break or a reset.  Try to organize your studying in 1.5 hour increments with a 15-20 minute break between sessions where you go for a walk, take care of a quick chore or chat with a friend.  Then, return to your next study session.     -Focus music:  Check YouTube or your favorite music channels for focus music that you can play in the background while you study.  This might help to keep you on task and also get more accomplished in a shorter amount of time.   -Turn off all notifications:  Turn off all alerts, alarms and notifications for anything (text, email, etc.) and put your phone on silent during the 1.5 hour study time.  If you are working on your computer, close out your emails and all social media accounts.  Almost everything you will be notified about can wait until the 15-20 minute break, allowing you to not be distracted.  The study sessions will stick more effectively and you will be able to cover more material.   -Plan the material:  Plan out the topics or materials that need to be covered during the 1.5 hours (this should be what is most important/what should be done now.)  This way there is a good goal to accomplish by the end and you will be able to better assess how much more or less time you may need for the topic at hand.  It will also help you from jumping around too much and getting off track. "

How to keep confidence to study?, It took me a couple of years to figure that out in college.  I found ways to study with others in my class and that helped tremendously.

Or perhaps more often but with more breaks in between. 
"If I cannot find a job in my career field after college, what should I do?"," If you use the process which I present below, you will increase your chances of not only landing an appropriate job in your career area, but you will be well prepared if you ever lose your job and have to seek another.  At least 80% of people who find jobs find them through the creation and maintenance of interpersonal networking relationships developed through the following processes.     Getting to know yourself and how your personality traits relate to people involved in various career opportunities is very important in your decision making process. During my many years in Human Resources and College Recruiting, I ran across too many students who had skipped this very important step and ended up in a job situation which for which they were not well suited. Selecting a career area is like buying a pair of shoes.

"If I cannot find a job in my career field after college, what should I do?"," Katy,     You will find a job in physical therapy!! So long as insurance continues to cover PT, doctors will keep sending us. As one who is at the tail end of the baby boomer generation, I can tell you, there is a lot of work, esp. here in San Antonio. I encourage you to develop good references as you go. This includes not only the actual skill and knowledge of PT, but the other skills. . . customer service - how you treat people in any environment, is important! Documentation - your ability to keep detailed and accurate records -wherever you acquire the skill, is transferable! Privacy - ability to be discreet and safeguard client information - it could be credit card numbers, phone and address - not just medical info.  Infectious disease control - even good sanitation practices handling food service ----All of this transfers and will go to show you will be a good employee!     As to San Antonio, there are much more than simple outpatient PT facilities. Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) offer 1 hr of therapy per day. LTACs - Long Term Acute Care Facilities - offer PT.  Some doctor offices offer PT - such as Northeast Orthopedics and also TSAOG (the San Antonio Orthopedic Group- a top rated employer to work for - even if you start in admin, look into getting a job here!). Hospitals have rehab. This includes Northeast Methodist, which has an orthopedic wing.  Places like Warm Springs do 3 hours of therapy a day, usually in 2 sessions, spread apart. They make sure patients can bathe and dress safely, climb steps, etc.     In addition to PT is OT, occupational therapy, which teaches people how to safely function. There is a lot of concern for the aging populace, which is very prone to falling and increasingly live alone. Teaching them how to reach, bend, etc, and improving their balance. My parents are in their 80 is - I have been around a lot of this! They also do  a lot of therapy for patients recovering from illness. When an older person has been bed-ridden for 7-10 days they lose a lot of muscle tone!      However, you can also work with younger people. They want to stay 100% functional . . . I have seen them in therapy - hand injuries , fractures, etc.  They are a very motivated group!      I realize I have not answered the question. The short answer is, you find something else, and keep trying to get into your field. However, the longer you are out of school without going into your field, the harder it is to get into it. So, should this happen, you want to at least stay close to your field - such as having a different job in a PT or doctor is office.  I read somewhere that truly successful people do not have a ""Plan B,"" as they do not expect to fail. That sort of makes sense. It is also sort of scary.  Again, with all the facilities in and around San Antonio, I expect you will find a job! "
"Do public defenders have the same  requirement as lawyers (Bar exam, etc) ?"," Some public defenders are gov not employees, where others are private practitioners appointed by the courts to handle certain cases for indigent clients. It is an excellent way to start out a career in law. It is not always just about money. You will be exposed to a wide variety of cases, learn the realities of plea bargaining (most cases do not go to trial), and see how often innocent people plead guilty because they are afraid to take their chances with the judicial system.    Prosecutors are also gov not employees, and of course, they are on the other side, trying to send people to prison or jail. They too are overworked many times, and I have seen them in trial totally unprepared, because the case has dragged out for two years, and changed prosecutors three times.Most lawyers do not stay with the prosecutors office for their entire careers, they use it as a stepping stone, often, to go into criminal defense.

How important is attending  film school in boosting one is chance of breaking into the film/television industry?  I have heard debates on both sides but am still undecided as to whether it is a good investment.," This is a difficult question to answer because there are people in the film industry that feel strongly on both sides of this issue. I want to be careful in answering so as not to make any enemies. On the other hand I think someone needs to give some sound advice to this often asked question. So, here goes. There was a time where film school was a must, today however many things have changed. I believe that schooling is important for a film or TV career, but what schooling is the real question. Get your feet wet working in the industry. There are a lot of smaller independent productions you can get involved in. This will help you find the area of production that interests you or that you are best suited for. Then you can decide what education would be best for the specific film career you are interested in.

alright so what should i do if  want to enter the world of forensics?," Step 1: Choose a Discipline Your first step is to choose a discipline. Forensic science is a broad field, integrating various disciplines of science in the pursuit of civil justice. Professionals in this field may specialize in toxicology, pathology, physical anthropology, behavioural science and general forensics, among other specialities.   Step 2: Earn a Bachelor is Degree You must have at least bachelor is degrees to find employment in this occupation. Depending on the chosen discipline, students may focus their studies on the natural or biological sciences. For example, students interested in a career in toxicology may focus on microbiology, while those looking to begin a career in forensic ballistics may choose to focus on physics.   Some colleges and universities offer Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science programs. Employing classroom and laboratory instruction, these 4-year degree programs combine various sciences applicable to forensic science. Courses may include:   Microbiology Genetics Human anatomy Organic chemistry Toxicology Physics Evidence analysis Forensic anthropology Public speaking   Step 3: Consider an Advanced Degree According to the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, some disciplines require only bachelor is degrees, while others may require advanced degrees in applicable fields of science or medicine. So the third step is to consider an advanced degree. Forensic anthropologists typically have Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in anthropology with focuses on human osteology and anatomy. Forensic ondontologists must have at least Doctor of Dental Science (DDS) degrees. Forensic pathologists must obtain medical licensure from the American Board of Pathology, which requires four years of medical school and five years of combined residency and fellowship training.   Step 4: Gain Experience Forensic scientists typically work in laboratories, hospitals, morgues, government facilities and police departments. Specific job duties vary according to discipline, but forensic scientists generally conduct scientific investigations and analyse findings to reveal details about occurrences, such as deaths, car accidents, and non-violent crimes. They work closely beside crime scene investigators, officers, deputies, and attorneys. Forensic scientists may serve as expert witnesses in criminal trials, where they present their findings to juries and judges.   Step 5: Obtain Certification The last step is to obtain certification. Earning a voluntary professional certification may help you demonstrate your competence in your specialty. The American Board of Criminalistics (ABC) offers two levels of certification for practicing  forensic scientists. Candidates for diploma certification must hold bachelor is degrees in an applicable science, have two years of experience in criminology and pass a 220-question certification examination. Candidates for fellow certification must meet all diplomate requirements, complete a proficiency testing program and pass a comprehensive exam. "

How does someone create a software?," Hi Gloria,   Software is a general term for the various kinds of programs used to operate computers and related devices. I understand yes the name of it sounds complex and confusing. But the more you will get in depth of the subject the more interesting you will find it .However here is a simple program that you can use to create a clock using the notepad. All you need to do is just copy the following code and paste this in a notepad document. Then save it as batch file I mean saving with .bat extension. Follow the steps below:    1.Go to the Desktop. (You can do it anywhere. But desktop will be more convenient.) 2.Click right mouse button and select Text Document to open Notepad. (Or Press Start + R &gt; type Notepad &gt; hit Enter)  3.Now copy the following code and paste it in the newly created text document.  4.Save the file as Clock.bat (Save it on Desktop or anywhere you like). 5 Now you will see a batch file named Clock.bat 6 Double click on it to see the result!     @echo  off Title DOS Based Date and Clock color b cls : Clock cls echo Current Date: %date% echo .............  echo ............. echo Current Time: %time% goto Clock   You can also customize the code as below-  You can change the Title of the code. Look at the title- Dos Based Date and Clock. You can use any name instead of the blue part.  You can also change the color. Here I have used b for Aqua. You can use- 0 for black, 1 for  blue, 2 for green, thus you can test 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, c, d, e, f. Each one will give you a different color!

How does someone create a software?," Gloria,   All software is, is basically instructions to tell the computer what to do. To create a software application, you need to have a problem that can be solved with symbols. Software starts with simple pieces (or functions) that are assembled into great structures, like lego blocks are built into sculptures.    Here is a simple program that inputs the number, tests the number to see if it is less than zero and if it is, it changes the font color to be red. Then it prints the number on the screen. The words in all capitals are the key word instructions to the computer. the less than sign &lt;, and the equals sign = are also key words The computer follows the instructions line by line.   INPUT num IF num &lt; 0,     THEN fontcolor = ""red"" ENDIF PRINT num   INPUT is a function that allows you to type a number on the keyboard and press return. Then the value of the number you typed in is stored in a variable called num. A variable is a memory location (or a little storage box) with a label. num and fontcolor are the labels of the two variables used in the function.    In the INPUT function. When the computer reads the word num, it finds the memory location that has the num label and puts the new value in it,  In the IF statement, the computer copies the value in the location labeled num and uses it to compare against the value of zero. If the comparison is true, the instructions after the keyword THEN are performed. In this case, the word ""red"" is stored in the variable labeled fontcolor. If the comparison is not true, the computer skips to after the key word ENDIF. The PRINT statement, displays the value of num on the screen using the font color specified in the variable fontcolor.   This is a very short, and hopefully simple, introduction to software. You can learn more by researching what you can do with a Raspberry Pi computer.    www.raspberrypi.org    Under the  Help  menu, locate the  Documentation...  section. In that section, there is a  Usage  button (it has a rocket on it). Click the  Usage  button. There are three languages that are described.    Python   This is a full blown language that is easy to learn, but powerful enough for professional programmers to use.    Scratch   This is a language that is graphical. You piece different blocks together and change the values in the block to make a program. This language is usually taught to children because it is easy.    Sonic Pi   This is a language that will teach you how to program, but the output is music. If you know a even little bit about playing music or singing, start with this language, but remember, it is a programming language, not music software.  It looks like computer software, but sounds like music.    All of these languages are available for free on computers other than a Raspberry Pi.  Besides, Raspberry Pi, I think Sonic Pi is only available on a Macintosh. "
How does someone create a software?, In practice software can be complicated or fairly mundane depending on what type of job you have.  Some software developers are great at building complicated systems other are really good at looking at others work and finding bugs.  Some are really good at taking other people work and making modifications to suit the requirements of a current project. Others are really good a taking big pieces and putting them together.  Others may not have good skills but are really innovative in how they think and provide valuable insight to others doing the heavy lifting    All take different skill sets and temperments.  Bottom line if you are good with logic and can get through your math you have a fit in one of the areas. 
How does someone create a software?," You are correct that software can be complex.   So you should start with some simple examples. Take a look at http://codecademy.com/ for some examples to get you started.    Lots of things are complex -- building a house, painting a picture, even writing a paragraph. They all take practice. So, practice! "
Are nonprofits typically at career fairs?," Hi Mounia,   Yes, I would agree that some nonprofits may be represented at job fairs, but that is not really the best place to find them. Smaller nonprofits especially may not have the resources to send someone to a job fair; it does not really make sense to put time into that type of event when you have few openings.    I highly recommend you check out idealist.org, a nonprofit job search website. By looking at job postings in your area, you can get a sense of what nonprofits are around. If you are interested in a job or internship in the near future, I would suggest you concentrate on applying to existing openings rather than contacting nonprofits to ask about work or volunteering.    Of course, if you are interested in volunteering, or hoping to network with nonprofit professionals, by all means reach out to folks at local nonprofits. I would just suggest you keep in mind that many nonprofits are extremely busy and people may not always be responsive to you if you reach out with general questions. It is not necessarily that they do not want to assist you, it is just that nonprofits get a variety of emails from prospective volunteers/interns/staff and it is hard to have time to connect with everyone.    However, if you are interested in networking, you should definitely give it a try! You may have more success if you tell them (briefly) a little bit about your background, including what school you attend, what you are interested in studying, and why you want to learn more about the nonprofit field. Tell them what interests you about their specific nonprofit and its mission, ask if they would have time for a call or meeting, and thank them for their time and for considering your request.   Good luck!   Kate "
Are nonprofits typically at career fairs?," Sometimes they are but if you want to work for nonprofits, you should be targeting them. Dont wait for them to target you..you will have to hold your breath on this one. Instead do a search for the agencies http://grantspace.org/tools/knowledge-base/Funding-Research/Statistics/number-of-nonprofits-in-the-u.s. Find out what department you want to work in and contact the local contact about your interest. Have your resume ready. Read their reports for an idea about their challenges. Then tell them how you can be of service to them. Highlight your skills that address activities listed in their strategic plans.  "
Are there univerities that major in both biomedical studies and some sort of voice performance major?, Usually state universities provide a variety of programs like this. I would search collegeboard.org and use their college finder filters. 
What are some job possibilities for a Biotechnology major?," The two main markets in the Biotech industry are medical and agricultural.    A variety of jobs for science majors are offered in this industry some of which include engineers (very often PhDs) who research and develop  new products, formulators (medical technologists, chemists, biologists) who manufacture the product, quality control technologists (medical technologists, chemists, biologists, clinical lab scientists) who typically do the testing, and quality assurance employees who monitor policies, procedures and regulations (FDA,ISO) to insure a quality product.  Technical service representatives (who have a high level understanding of the product line)  are also needed as they typically respond to solve customer is questions and problems. "

How do you keep from being cynical when teaching in K-12 or public schools?," You need an excellent teacher prep program, experience, and compassion. Many colleges provide incredible teaching programs. A few of the best in the nation are Johns Hopkins University, NYU, and UConn     Teaching involves a number of different skills and qualities. I would say the most important are:      People skills - being friendly and working well with others. You will need to be personable, caring, kind, friendly, compassionate, and understanding. These qualities make a great teacher. But you also need to be stern and firm in your directions, rules, and discipline  Public speaking - every day in your class you will need to be able to speak and present information to your students, practice speech, and practice fluency of language and talking in front of others  The subject you plan to teach - become a master of the subject you plan to teach, make sure you know as much as possible and learn as much as you can about the subject you plan to teach. Take as many classes as possible in this subject and learn everything you can about it.  Psychology &amp; Human Development - start reading books and research articles on human development and psych. It will be helpful for you to know how people learn at different stages and the best ways to teach them at these stages (depending on stage of development and schema).     "
How do you keep from being cynical when teaching in K-12 or public schools?,"Hi LIndsey,  Questioning, being cynical, losing your fire are all part of the process of being a lifelong learner - a person every teacher should be. Yes, there are competing forces that could make you wonder what you should do, which do I put first, how does the reform help me ..... You will feel the challenges of teaching and have lots of times when you are wondering about your career. That is actually really good - We teach ourselves in education to be reflective. Turn the burner up on your fire when you see yourself being cynical. Remember why you are a teacher ..... hold onto your initial dreams and hopes .... they will carry you over the rough waters.  And as Meridyth said .... really great question!  Stephanie"
How do you keep from being cynical when teaching in K-12 or public schools?," The teachers I have met and worked with choose not to be cynical but to focus their energy on the very many positives of helping to teach our future generation.&nbsp; We all have the ability to react to various situations according to our own values.&nbsp; At the end of every day, think about all the good things you were able to do.     With every good wish! "
How do you keep from being cynical when teaching in K-12 or public schools?,"Hi Lindsey,  This is a great question! There are alot of different policies, programs and reform movements that come and go through public education. It can be hard to not become discouraged or cynical at times. Especially when it comes to things that may affect you personally. The most important thing to remember is that you are there to teach the students. They are your main focus no matter what is happening around you.   The  students should always feel supported and engaged.  Whatever you may be personally feeling should never come into the classroom.  Your students will feel your emotions and can feed off of them.   Keeping focused on making  well-round and caring citizens of the future. #teaching  #k-12-education "
What do you know now that you wish you knew as a senior in college?," 1) Performance from high school carries no weight the moment you graduate from high school. 2)  Having a plan is good but not necessary because college is not what you think it will be (for better or for worse), and chances are, you are not who you think you are either. 3) You will change. This is okay. 4a) Some of your friendships will end for no other reason than the involved parties have changed. This is okay. Good, even. 4b) Invest in the relationships you want to keep; the best relationships do not happen passively. 5a) Take as many diverse classes in college. The more different from your major, the better.  5b) If you can not fit a class in your schedule that you want to take for pleasure, you can always audit it. 6) Learn outside of the classroom: volunteer events, internships, research opportunities, studying abroad, clubs. 7) Three months of summer break is great. Do not waste it.  8) Consider becoming an RA. It is a commitment not to be taken lightly, but it will be awesome on your resume and save you a ton of money. 9) LEARN TO COOK. College is the best time to learn to cook. If anything, overpriced, subpar cafeteria food alone should be good enough reason to learn how to adult and cook. 10) You are not an adult, but you are not a child. You are both. Make the best of it. "
What do you know now that you wish you knew as a senior in college?, I wish that I had signed up to be an intern at a company before I graduated. Peers who were interns in their senior year got jobs right away at those top companies! Would also recommend reading books or watching videos on money management to help you achieve your life goals. I love Suze Orman books or video programs. She explains financial strategies in an easy to understand way.  
How to get more involved in the community?," Hi Tiffanie,      I would also suggest checking with your employer if you are currently working. Here at PwC we have a number of community lead initiatives,  and we  are encourage to give back to the community through volunteering  and fundraising. If you are not currently in work, but actively looking, a good question for potential employers is if they encourage getting involved with the community, and if so how. Especially if this is something you are passionate about.  More and more employees are beginning to recognise the importance of giving back, and encouraging their employees to actively participate.      Best of luck to you! "

How to improve my CV as a computer Engineering student?," Hello Maya,  you are doing great with your curriculum and your high CGPA will hold you in good stead.  I think you are missing on your strength. You must have done good in your project(s) or App development etc, make a mention, howsoever trivial that may appear to you. I have some more actions to suggest:   Look beyond your curriculum: You may work on developing an App or a small macro say connecting two platforms seamlessly like What is App/Voot/Hangout and see if you can customize to make it useful for Digital Marketing/Social Engineering.   I am looking at the issue of bank or credit card frauds: how to stop cyber attacks against banks by studying the gaps in the existing system, if you get an opportunity. There is a time lag between fraud detection/ reporting and risk mitigation, presently it goes even upto 90 days or more.There are gaps even in the Operating systems  and Ransomewares like Wannacry or Petyacry are exploiting these gaps/or soft spots and punching hole in it, so develop a patch. In fact, possibilities are endless.    I worked on a project to connect the Antenna system with a software to control the output and beam it at a particular direction and controlled the power output so that there is no spurious transmission (side or back lobes). Today you have robotics and AI to help in these kinds of projects/products.  May be you work on an OS based on Sanskrit! Develop a model or do system analysis, if you can.   Assess your capability/liking and working on it as an hobby. Keep looking at the problems we face in day to day world and try to pick up one issue that you can work on.  Mention these efforts/products(if you develop and showcase it in your CV).   In addition, mention your strength on the subjects like: OS, Data Structures, AI and Robotics or languages  etc.    "
How to improve my CV as a computer Engineering student?," To create a better CV you need to follow a step by step career advice to start it well.

How to improve my CV as a computer Engineering student?,"Hi Maya! I think you are doing an amazing job thinking about future prospects. It is definitely very important to diversify your CV and add things that are not just computer science related. I think good ones to start off with could be volunteering in your community, tutoring students (since you have a high GPA), getting involved in something you are passionate about in your college (it is never too late even if you are a third year). Also, I would say if you specifically want to focus on international projects, maybe try entering international competitions for coding and try winning those (look for female coding competition, engineering coding competitions,..) and then add those to your resume - you can also try doing an international study abroad/internship to help.

how many years of school do you have to take to be an advice columnist?," To love helping people by giving them asked for good advice is a wonderful thing to do. To become an excellent advice columnist, it would be important to go to college to learn writing (how you say something is as important as what advice you are giving - to develop a writing style), psychology (how people think and respond to different advice), and perhaps even law (sometimes someone is problem and how it is solved may have legal implications. Getting a B.A. degree in one of these subjects (or through a dual major in, say, writing and psychology) would really give you the credentials to develop a career in this area. Also, college gives you connections - through other students, teachers, advisors, alumni - who can help open doors for possible internships working with an advice columnist and, eventually, become an advice columnist. Good luck!  "
What software do you need to create a game?," Unity is a good starting point. It is free and there are a lot of pre made assets to build games and or prototypes quickly.  http://unity3d.com/   UDK is a good, free option as well: https://www.unrealengine.com/products/udk/   If you want to create games with their latest, it will cost you ~$20 a month: https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4   In addition, the following will be helpful for asset creation: For modeling, a free option is Blender: http://www.blender.org/   For image manipulation and a good alternative to Photoshop, Gimp: http://www.gimp.org/   If you are more interested in the technical side of things and have a game engine that you want to work with, you will need a programming IDE. Unity comes with a programming IDE called MonoDevelop. It is included with the installation of Unity but here is a link to read about it: http://monodevelop.com/   If you are on a Mac and want to write in Objective C, C, C++, other languages, you can get a free programming IDE from the OSX app store or here: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/   For Windows, Visual Studio: https://www.dreamspark.com/student/   For Linux and all OS is really, Eclipse: http://www.eclipse.org/   It is the game engine that run the original Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein etc. and is released for free from ID below. There are XCode project files there as well to easily load into XCode. https://github.com/id-Software   The original Doom source: https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM   A fun creative C++ toolkit called OpenFrameworks which is not a game engine per se but you can build games in it for many platforms. Check out the projects created with it on their site: http://openframeworks.cc/ "
What software do you need to create a game?," It depends on many things. Web, mobile, standalone etc. iOS, Android, Windows phone.   The software or IDE (intergrated development environment) is secondary (or even lower down the list) to other things.   A game concept, a target audience for who would like to play the game etc.   The first game I wrote was a quiz, which was more an exercise in creating something my friends would like to play (that was 30+ years ago)  Now there are so many tutorials and free libraries/tools to make the creation of very flashy and impressive looking games that the actual need to be a strong programmer has been reduced and now the big thing is the idea.   However to actual answer the question. Any computer language can be used to create a game, however to create mobile based games tools like Unity, cocos2dx etc are extremely powerful and allow the user to create a game which can then be deployed (played) on many different platforms from web, mobile devices and even consoles.  "
What software do you need to create a game?," You need 3 main tools  - a game engine, tools for art and sound.     You can use either Unity or Unreal if you are looking for a professional engine, they both have a free or very low cost version to get you started.  They will enable you to build games on many different platforms and to port your games.  If these engines are more complex than you need take a look at Game Salad.  One of the things I like most about Unity is their Asset store.  You can buy (or get for free) a number of pre-built components, art assets and sounds that you can use in your game.   For art, you can use things like Maya, 3DS Max, Photoshop, Illustrator or you can go the free route and look into the dozens of free painting and drawing packages available.  On top of that you can look into royalty free art either from the Unity Asset store or on the web in general.   Finally for sound using something as simple and free as Audacity or Garage Band will take you a long way in creating a sound track.  If you really want to get into it you should look at FMOD to enable dynamic sound and ProTools for high end mixing.   There are lots of options you need to find ones that fit your style, skills and goals. "
What software do you need to create a game?," Unity and Unreal Engine are very powerful tools but the learning curve is steep.

How long does it take to truly pursue a career in Psychology?," Hey Laura, in order to become a psychologist and operate your own practice (seeing clients) you will need to earn your bachelor is degree (four years), master is degree (1-2 years), and your doctorate (PhD)...which can take from five to seven years.     Some individuals choose to work in private practice, some work with a group of counselors and psychologists in one location (group practice), some work in academia (working with college students who are having mental and emotional challenges, ex. depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, panic disorders, etc.) There are a lot of things you can do. I have offered a few examples for you to think about.     Additionally, see the link below for detailed information.     Warmly,  erinn e. "
How long does it take to truly pursue a career in Psychology?,"I think it really depends on how far you want to go with it and your the state regulations where you live.

Computer software engineers apply the principles and techniques of computer science, engineering, and mathematical analysis to the design, development, testing, and evaluation of the software and the systems that enable computers to perform their many applications.   Software engineers are involved in the design and development of many types of software, including software for operating systems and network distribution, and software for compilers (which convert programs for execution on a computer). In programming, or coding, software engineers instruct a computer, line by line, how to perform a desired function. Software engineers must possess strong programming skills, but are often more concerned with developing algorithms and analyzing and solving programming problems than with actually writing code.   Typically software engineers, working in applications or systems development, analyze first the needs of the user. They then design, construct, test, and maintain computer applications software or systems to meet these needs.   Computer Applications Software Engineers  Computer applications software engineers analyze user needs and design, construct, and maintain general computer applications software or specialized utility programs. These engineers use different programming languages, depending on the purpose of the program. The programming languages most often used are C, C++, and Java, with Fortran and COBOL used less commonly. Some software engineers develop both packaged systems and systems software, or create customized applications.   Computer Systems Software Engineers Computer systems software engineers coordinate the construction and maintenance of a company is computer systems and plan their future growth. Working with the company, they coordinate each department is computer needs - such as ordering, inventory, billing, and payroll recordkeeping - and make suggestions about the appropriate technical direction. The engineers also might set up the company is intranets, namely the networks that link computers within the organization and ease communication among the various departments.   Systems software engineers work for companies that configure, implement, and install complete computer systems. These engineers may be members of the marketing or sales staff, serving as the primary technical resource for sales workers and customers. They may also be involved with technical support to the company is customers. Since the selling of complex computer systems often requires substantial customization for the purchaser is organization, software engineers help to explain the requirements necessary for installing and operating the new system in the purchaser is computing environment. One of the major responsibilities of systems software engineers is ensuring a proper level of security across the systems they are configuring.

How can I make money with Photography?," Hi Gordon.  Great question.  Photography is a great hobby, one that can also provide some financial benefits.  i have a few friends that are very avid photographers on the side that make a decent amount of spending cash on the side.   They started off with posting their best pictures on social media, usually through an account dedicated just for their pictures, and using hashtags to increase exposure to the account.  Usually, there next step was to continue to grow their portfolio, which occurred with photo shoots of nature, weddings, etc.  After their work received a decent amount of exposure, they would usually ask their friends to spread the word of their services, and also post on forums or websites listing their prices.  You may have to initially start with getting paid next to nothing when building your reputation and portfolio.  "
How can I make money with Photography?,"Hi, Gordon. The best way to use photography as a career choice is in photojournalism.  I would check with campuses where you live and see which ones offer photojournalism as a major, or you can use your photography hobby and start a photography business, where you take photos of people in your photography studio.  It is good to use your photographs, and develop your own portfolio to show to different employers as well.  There is so much you can do with photography, but I would expand my skills into journalism, because you can work for print magazines, digital magazines, newspapers, and even copyright your photos as well, and start a photography book."

Do optometrists have trouble finding job openings once graduated?," Employment of optometrists is projected to grow 27 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations.   Because vision problems tend to occur more frequently later in life, an aging population will require more optometrists. As people age, they become more susceptible to conditions that impair vision, such as cataracts and macular degeneration.   The number of people with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, has grown in recent years. Diabetes has been linked to increased rates of several eye conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, a condition that affects the blood vessels in the eye and may lead to loss of vision. More optometrists will be needed to monitor, treat, and refer individuals with chronic conditions stemming from diabetes.   In addition, nearly all health plans cover medical eye care and many cover preventive eye exams. Furthermore, the number of individuals, particularly children, who have access to vision or eye care insurance is expected to continue to increase because of federal health insurance reform. More optometrists will be needed to provide services to more patients.   Optometrists Job Prospects   Because the number of optometrists is limited by the number of accredited optometry schools, licensed optometrists should expect good job prospects. Like admission to professional degree programs in other fields, admission to optometry programs is highly competitive.   Students who choose to complete a residency program gain additional experience that may improve their job prospects. Certification from the American Board of Optometry may also be viewed favorably by employers.   In addition, a large number of currently practicing optometrists are expected to retire over the coming decade, creating opportunities for new optometrists "

What do you put on your resume when you have never had a job before?," Hi Sydney! Think of other activities, volunteer work, or leadership experiences you have from home or school. Do you volunteer anywhere? Have you helped your neighbors by walking their dogs or house sitting? Are you involved in any extra-curricular activities such as sports or clubs, music or arts? Think outside the box in presenting the types of experiences that you do have as a benefit to the prospective employer. Even class projects where you took on a leadership role can help you. Mention honor roll or any similar academic awards you may have earned. Employers do not expect a long or extensive resume for someone applying for entry-level part-time jobs. Your resume can simply should show that even though you may not have been working, you were doing productive things with your time and applying yourself to your school work, all of which helped prepare you for your first job.  Good luck in your job search! "
What do you put on your resume when you have never had a job before?," For starters, do not worry too much about not having prior work experience. We all have to start somewhere. I recommend you start by asking yourself ""what have I done in the past five years?"" This can include organizations you have participated in, activities you have done inside/outside of school, any anything really that you have donated your time to. Then ask yourself ""what honors or special mentions have I received in the past five years?"" These honors can be as simple as receiving honor roll in school. Finally ask yourself ""what are other features of myself that make me marketable/unique?"" Answering these three questions will help you amass a great resume that illustrates all of your great qualities even if you do not have any prior work experience.  "
What do you put on your resume when you have never had a job before?," Focus on activities or organizations that you may have participated in. Cite examples where you obtained a favorable result that emphasize basic skills i.e. organization, motivational, communication, ability to move a project or task forward and obtain support of the group. These are basic skills any potential employer is looking for. More than likely an interviewer will recognize limited experience and is looking for someone willing to learn with a good attitude that is reliable. "
What do you put on your resume when you have never had a job before?," Hi,   This is a good one.

How much time should I be spending on homework in college?," Hello Alicia,  I would recommend to create a daily or weekly schedules, in which you include some breaks from studying and   some time for hobbies or fun activities. Discipline is key.  Make sure to still dedicate enough time for your homework and that you do not include ""too many"" breaks :) .  Making breaks and allowing yourself time to clear your mind should help you to get back to your homework with a rested brain, which should ultimately help you to study better.  The most important thing is to commit to your schedule and stick to it.  Good luck.    "

What does it take to be a massage therapist?," I want to give you an honest answer okay. I do not want you to fail. If you want to make any money or get a job as a masseuse is not the field you want to take. There are NO jobs I know so many people unemployed in this field. Please do not take it. IF you want to make money and be a maseuse, then take Physical Therapy. You will help people recover from injuries by massaging parts of the injured area that have atrophy, from not walking on or an arm injury, hand injury etc you do massage those areas and guess what you will make great money and get a great job for sure. The U.S. has a huge huge shortage in this area of P.T. so I would get on board with that and you can start as an assistant to P.T. or O.T. right away. Even an assistant in this field has great benefits and is very high in demand. I am sorry, I am truthful and I do not want you to make a mistake. Please look at the stats on unemployed Massage Theapist. Huge. If you do not want much schooling, I suggest a community college where they specialise in areas, and college classes that you will need for any degree. Start with your General ED. YOU must have those no matter what you take. English, math, reading all the good stuff. Once you have completed those, I am sure by then you will know more about the programs offered that have growth and you want to take a program that is high in demand or you will not work in this economy. I wish you the very best in whatever you choose to do. Good luck! "
Will technology ever make human teachers irrelevant in education?," Great question Maggie,     I hope not! As a teacher, I find a lot of good comes out of human interactions and having the physical presence of someone for the students to look to. It also helps form rapport with students and decreases the chances of problems in the classroom. Certainly, technology is an amazing tool and at times can be used in place of a physical teacher. However, technology is limiting and can be risky (ie power failure, slow internet, electrical issues). I for one, hope we can use technology more in the classroom, but not at the expense of replacing teachers.     I feel like this would be a great plot for a movie, just throwing it out there... :)  "
Will technology ever make human teachers irrelevant in education?," Hi Maggie,   I hope technology does not replace us! I just got an article that I will copy and paste part of   the article here about blended learning .... blending technology with human teachers! It is one way to integrate both types of learning. But in the end, human teachers will always exist!   Stephanie   Four Keys To Success Using Blended Learning Implementation Models Elizabeth Brooke, Ph.D., CCC-SLP Chief Education Officer, Lexia Learning   A growing number of schools are piloting or implementing blended learning programs. However, many educators are unfamiliar with the different aspects of this approach and how the various implementation models of blended learning differ. Technology-laden terms like “one-to-one” and “flipped learning” make blended learning an intriguing—if not daunting—endeavor. However, the foundation of blended learning remains firmly rooted in the concept of empowering teachers to provide personalized and mastery-based instruction.   One common misconception is that simply integrating technology into the school day constitutes a blended learning approach. The mere presence of technology, though, does not constitute a blended learning approach. Instead, it’s the educators’ ability to leverage technology to personalize and streamline the learning process for students that makes blended learning an effective way to maximize the impact of teacher time through direct instruction.   When blended learning incorporates adaptive technology, real-time progress monitoring, and provides the recommended next steps to customize instruction for each student, teachers become more targeted, time efficient and effective in improving students’ overall reading abilities. Educators will embrace blended learning when they are included in the decision-making process, understand the benefits of new initiatives, and have the skills—or the support to develop the skills—to accomplish what is being asked of them. "
Will technology ever make human teachers irrelevant in education?," Your question reminds me of the poem ""What Teachers Make"" by Taylor Mali, a teacher. Here is a link  to the poem  https://www.taylormali.com/poems-online/what-teachers-make/  . I heard Taylor Mali, in person, on stage,  recite this poem many years ago at an assembly in a high school where I was teaching. His contact with the audience of both students and faculty  was direct and his performance of this particular poem electrified the room, offering food for thought for days, years even. I think you can answer your question by thinking about teachers who have ""made a difference"" for you, and imagining that taking place without the agency of that particular teacher.  Experience being a very good teacher, I applaud your initiative to finish a Teacher Cadet course to learn first hand ""what teachers make"" and I am sure your quest for the answer to your question will be an interesting journey.  "
Will technology ever make human teachers irrelevant in education?," This is a very good question.  There are ways that people can get college degrees without ever stepping into the classroom, but the interaction of the professor and your classmates cannot be replaced by technology.  You still have the interaction with your classmates and professor, even if it is virtually.       Teachers are also needed to help younger kids learn as some of the teachings in younger grades involve nature and positive reinforcements.       So I do not believe that teachers will become irrelevant, but instead they will be part of the process when it comes to delivering education via a technology medium. "

what goals should I set for myself to become a athletic trainer?," Hi Nicholas, Athletic trainers are well versed in the sciences including biology, chemistry and physics.  Please review the information on http://www.nata.org/career-education as in order to be a licensed trainer you want to receive your education from an accredited provider.  I would encourage you to look into athletic training classes through your local community college as some privately run programs (offered through your local gym) may be both expensive and not accredited.  You may also want to look into schools that offer exercise physiology or performance studies.  Most importantly, as a trainer you need to be a model of good health.   Good Luck!   Natalie "
What is the difference between data science and machine learning?," Data Science is a rather broad field that covers many areas, and machine learning is one of them. Data Science in the industry currently has three major tracks: analytics, generalist, and machine learning.       Analytics requires minimum statistical background and it requires someone to have keen business sense, and the ability to break down business problems into different aspects and do deep dives. Major skills needed for this track are: data pulling, data processing &amp; dashboarding.   Generalist track requires you to solve a business / product problem end-to-end. You need to be able to understand the real problem, and has good business sense, knows how to solve it, and come up with a solution using statistical or modeling approach.  Machine learning track requires you to understand the problem, and could figure out what are the suitable ML techniques to apply here, which models you could apply and how to fine tune them with reasonable performance evaluation. You would also need to know how to have your model built in the product, how to evaluate its real-time performance, etc. Sometimes it is not the issue of simply building one model, it could become a ML system design problem that could involve multiple components.   "
What is the difference between data science and machine learning?," Data science is a discipline that works with machine learning and Big Data, as well as many other things. I work as a Data Scientist, and while I do use machine learning and Big Data in my job, it is not all I do.  Also, you need to consider that there are different types of data scientists.       Machine Learning is, at its most basic, a predictive model created by feeding it data. Let us imagine we have a list of houses that sold recently. We have two columns, one with the square footage of the house and one with the price the house sold for. We could feed this data into a machine learning algorithm and it will build a model for us. Now if I ask the model how much a 2000 sq ft house will sell for, the model will provide us price based on the list of prices we had given it. Now obviously we use much more complex data sets with many many more variables, but at the end of the day machine learning boils down to asking a computer to either classify an object (is the picture a cat or dog?), provide a numeric value (regression - think of the house price example), or cluster (see how data should be best grouped based on attributes - think of all the students in your high school and how they can be grouped: jocks, drama clubs kids, nerds, popular crowd).     Big Data is massive, fast moving, data sets. It is a popular term, but not all data science or machine learning involves Big Data. Twitter is great example of big data with millions of tweets every few minutes.      In my case, I am what you might call an operational data scientist. I work in financial compliance at Verizon helping to hunt down people who are ""gaming the system"" or stealing from us by using loop holes in our policies. The biggest part of my job is finding, gathering, and cleaning data so I can analyze it. Once I have the data I may run it through a machine learning algorithm to create a predictive model they may help us to predict which people we should look at more closely (make the haystack a little smaller - easier to find the needle in.       A big data example I worked on with another company was using the voice recordings or people calling customer service. I was able to determine certain speech patterns that were more likely to be used by someone trying to commit some type of fraud. We were able to use this information to alert the customer care reps who to be on the look for. "
What is the difference between data science and machine learning?," ""data science"" is a more broad category, and ""machine learning"" is a subset. kinda like ""medicine"" would be a broad category and ""heart surgery"" would be a smaller subset of that discipline. So ""all machine learning is a type of data science, but not all data science involves machine learning""... ;-) "
What is the difference between data science and machine learning?, Data science includes the algorithms and processing methodology for entire data as well.  Machine learning includes the implementing different algorithms for data to get best output. 
What is the career path to be an successful  cosmetologist ?," Hello Eriana,   All cosmetologists and specialists have to complete a cosmetology training program to be eligible for state licensing exams. Cosmetology programs generally take 9-12 months to complete, but specialist programs can be completed in about six months.   Cosmetologists are required to complete training at a certified cosmetology school to get licensed. Most cosmetology schools base their curricula on state licensing requirements, but every state has different requirements. Nevertheless, common cosmetology coursework includes hair cutting and styling, safety procedures and business management. Most cosmetology programs also provide basic training in makeup application, manicures, massage therapy and skincare treatments. Cosmetology programs range from 1,000-1,500 hours.   Specialists   Students can choose to specialize in individual cosmetology fields. Estheticians, or skincare professionals, take courses that cover facial treatments, body wraps, skincare chemicals and body hair removal techniques. Nail technicians, also called manicurists, participate in coursework that covers manicures, pedicures, artificial nails, nail color treatments and nail diseases. Specialist programs typically require around 600 hours of coursework.   Both cosmetologists and specialists have to adhere to state licensing requirements. Most states have age restrictions, as well as minimum education requirements. To be eligible for licensing exams, individuals must complete a set number of training hours during cosmetology school.   Licensing exams can include written or practical tests, and sometimes both. Written exams cover questions about sanitation rules, chemical usage, hair styling techniques and state laws. Practical tests involve applicants following directions to style a mannequin or model. Some states also administer an oral examination in which applicants must provide verbal answers to cosmetology-related questions.   Many states have licenses for each cosmetology specialty.

Can you share your experience as a UX or UI designer? What is like? What takes you there?," UX/UI skills are great to have along with psychology to expand your career options. Human computer interaction (HCI) and graphic design courses will broaden your knowledge about user centered design as well.     A lot of companies are looking for hybrid designers that have these skills. Forbes wrote an article on this topic.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/03/23/the-bottom-line-why-good-ux-design-means-better-business/#12afef4d2396     I received my bachelor’s degree in graphic design and later on went back to school for a certificate in computer science. I went from graphic design to web design, to front-end-web-development, to digital design and now to UX/UI.     I found out along my career path that I loved exciting apps and websites that made my life easier and I wanted to be a part of creating those enjoyable experiences for other people. So, I took a bunch of courses on  Lynda.com, Treehouse.com and Udemy.com  just to learn other bits and tips outside of school. Lynda and Treehouse is discounted for students and Udemy is just really cheap. Most of the courses I took on Udemy range from $10 - $25 bucks. The most helpful course I took was a UX designer portfolio course on Udemy. It taught me exactly what to put in my portfolio. Companies not only want to see that you can design but they want to see the thought process behind your designs. As soon as I did that, I started applying for a job in UX and got one.     In my opinion, it never hurts to know the basic HTML and CSS. It’s not required for you to know how to code in order to be a UX/UI designer, but it helps when your interviewing for a job and they know you have the ability to understand the development process. A lot of designers and developers don’t speak the same language, so if you’re that person who can bridge the gap and help lessen any confusion or miscommunication, you’ll be a great asset to any team. You can learn to code for free on  codeacademy.com      The con of being a hybrid designer is that some companies will want you to exercise several of your skills on a daily basis but not really want to pay you for it. You’ll be involved in more areas of a project than anyone else at times and that could get stressful. You’ll want to discover what your passionate about and focus on it. Being excellent at one thing is much better than being ok at many things.     The pros in being a hybrid designer is that you’ll always be needed somewhere. You’ll be able to move through your career seamlessly and still be able to explore industries until you find your niche. I wish you the best of luck! "
Can you share your experience as a UX or UI designer? What is like? What takes you there?," In 2016, I did an internship as an UI/UX designer in a company. They were building a cross platform mobile application for a university. The general purpose of the app was focusing on achievements a student can make throughout their 4 or 5 years in college as a challenge and when they graduate they would get medals depending on achievements/challenges they have completed.     I was assigned to create a landing page for advertising this mobile application and it is features, as well as tweak/design icons and graphic images for the mobile application. Any web designer can make a simple landing page, but going through a proper documentation maintaining a good user interface design and also making sure it was user friendly was a bit hard at first, as I had to go back and forth and show it to my co-workers to find out how it looked like from their perspective. I was confident as I had hands on experience in various web programming languages. At first, we planned out the landing page in a piece of paper, then from that initial idea I made a mockup using Adobe illustrator and then converted that to HTML and CSS, then later on added some JavaScript and jQuery libraries to get a visual effect of the animation on the site. At the end, I was successfully able to make a commercial landing page as well as help with the UI design of the mobile application.     As an UI/UX designer you must be able to use Adobe tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator &amp; InDesign as well as have basic experience in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.     Courses:   If you are a type of person who likes to read and figure things out you could try codeacademy.com for learning basic web programming languages.  Otherwise for video based lessons you could use lynda.com , udemy.com       Major wise:  You can learn all of these even no matter what major you are. I have a friend who is majoring in psychology but she is also a great painter/artist. So I influenced her to get involved in graphics design and now she is a freelance designer besides studying in psychology and doing pretty well.  "
Can you share your experience as a UX or UI designer? What is like? What takes you there?," Hi Cindy,      I heard about UX when I was a senior in college and knew it was the right career path for me. I was a double major in Information Systems and Psychology with an Art minor. I really enjoyed both technical and creative classes. I then went to graduate school to study this field. For someone just starting out I would recommend taking some online courses to see if you are interested in the material. Lynda.com is a great place to start.      Coding experience is not necessary to obtain a position; however, it greatly helps your communication with developers. As a UX designer my role consists of conducting research, creating interface designs and working with developers to build out products. Having a knowledge of technical programming languages will definitely help you communicate with coworkers so I would recommend taking some HTML and CSS classes.      To become a UX designer you need to make a portfolio that shows your thought process on how you approach problems. Create a website that shows your coursework or make up side projects. Also, try to get an internship while you are still in school. An internship will give you real world experience, connections with people in industry and a project to add to your portfolio.      Good luck! "
Can you share your experience as a UX or UI designer? What is like? What takes you there?," The comments above are all great, I would like to add some perspective related to the strategic part of UX / UI design, the part that is most commonly referred to as 'UX Research'.  In fact, I would recommend you to consider all the following skills related to this area:    Trends and competitive analysis, interviews and focus group, survey... everything that will allow you to understand who your final users really are and what they want  The ability to write a brief to inform a creative team (or the design exercise you are going to do next), that you can develop up to the point of being able to write functional and/or technical requirements   These are just a couple of examples, but might be useful in terms of understanding the breadth of an UX professional, also offering yourself an alternative in case you are not so into the development side of UX/UI design.  If you get this skill, you might be able to be considered for jobs such as design / experience strategist and help your career as a creative director.  Happy to continue the discussion if you would like to know more. "

How quickly am I able to get a job in the career I pursued?," This can be a loaded question in all seriousness. It will depend on the field you are in and where you are willing to work. I think, generally, most people should be able to find a job in their field within a year. Personally, after graduating undergrad, I landed a great internship within 2 months, but after that ended, it took nearly a year for me to get another job in my field.  I suggest trying to find an internship you can do while still in school, preferably one that offers the potential for future employment within the company. Hone your resume, and tweak it for every  job you apply to. Same goes with cover letters. Be deliberate and do your research before interviews. There is nothing worse than getting the ""what do you know about us"" question and drawing a complete blank. "
How quickly am I able to get a job in the career I pursued?," You should be able to get a job within the six months after graduating!

In addition, you should consider doing an internship before graduation, that internship may turn into a full time position post graduation! Best of Luck! "
"How do you start building connections, in terms of business? (I am still a teenager)"," Hi Matthew,   That is a great question and very strategic thinking on your part. I have a couple of suggestions for you to consider.  If you know what type of business or specialization you are interested in, there are certain professional associations such as the American Marketing Assoc that have  college student membership options and host local chapter meetings.  You can also look into civic organizations such as your local Rotary Club in which members includes local business leaders and leaders in the community in general.  Rotary has a youth leadership program that would introduce you to their work and potentially  some highly influential people.   "
"How do you start building connections, in terms of business? (I am still a teenager)"," Hi Matthew S,     Coming from anyone at such young age, I am marveled that you think in this manner and delighted to help shed some light on the subject.  In anything in life, it is through people that things are achieved. Having good relations with others is key to mining the opportunities that matter the most.  Long Term relationships must be based on mutual interest and mutual respect and considerations.     I would say before meeting anyone, two important factors must be considered: 1) Finding the opportunities that are of most importance to you and within your scope of interest. and 2) Finding the contacts that open the door to these opportunities.  Time is a precious and limited commodity. But every time you meet someone, the connection must be genuine and meaningful. Not just to you, but to both. You must be willing and ready to be of service to others as well and as much as they may be of service to you.     First rule is : Social Skills. Common courtesies and good manners. LISTENING is very very important. The world and people will reveal themselves to you if you are willing to be receptive rather then responsive or expressive.     We meet people all the time, thousands, but which contacts do you wish to keep and build a long term and lasting relationships?  Business people have all sorts of contacts in all sorts of fields. I have more than 2000 contacts, but do not interact with them all the time. Some are distant, some personal and professional. They must be willing to take my call or answer my question, even when we have not seen each other in a while. Key is social skills and being genuine.     Some works just require a brief time and interaction, but all must be successful in the sense that people would want to collaborate with you and work with you again.  Some connections become a life time and personal friends. People and connections are an important marketing and social tool. But like above, do not be fake. Always be competent, Make it real and be positive and likable.     After business hours, there is always some kind of activity taking place, from sports, to games, to dinner, dance. During these activities business people make a deeper connection with others. Pretty much like lunch and cafeteria talks, sleep overs and spring break vacations. Lots of information is exchanged that lead to opportunities and meaningful contacts. In the business realm, it is called networking.     For higher level connections, try to join associations. They teach everything from public speaking to strategic thinking and service to society. It is all part of business life.     Let me know if this was useful, and if you have any other question, know that we are always here for you.    "
"How do you start building connections, in terms of business? (I am still a teenager)"," Matthew,     This is a fantastic question, and you are never too young to start building your book of business connections.  If there is one thing I can say with the utmost certainty, it is that you can never have too many connections.  Every time you meet someone new, no matter where you may be, it is an opportunity to make a new connection.  Network with any many people as you can.  Find areas of interest and find volunteer opportunities that will allow you to give back and network at the same time.  Join as many social type clubs/events/groups as you possibly can.  Whenever you get the opportunity, ask questions, find out what people do and follow-up with them.  Most people I know (including myself) especially enjoy mentoring young adults.  If you can find a mentor, they can assist you with finding different events you can attend and network with their contacts as well. "
"How do you start building connections, in terms of business? (I am still a teenager)"," You can start it anytime! A good way to start a network is be engaged in projects and activities in general. A fun fact about business connections is that they do not always start at a work place. Your neighbor, teammate at soccer, or colleagues from a project can connect you to companies or business lines. "
What do I need to major in if I want to be a pharmacist?," Chemistry and/or biology.&nbsp; Most of pharmacology studies are learned in graduate school, anyway.&nbsp; Most pharmacology schools mostly care about a related undergraduate degree.&nbsp; If you are going to a 2 year program, then moving to another school for the 4 year degree before applying to pharmacy school, it does not matter a whole lot what that is in, as long as it is related.&nbsp; Take chemistry and biology classes.

How hard is it to balance school and work?," Balancing school and work helps pull out strengths you would not know you have. I balanced school and work, and this was a time that humbled me. You have more Great days than bad ones. In the end, you get what you put in. Hard work brings rewards. "
How hard is it to balance school and work?," As with anything worth having l, it takes planning and discipline.  The planning starts before the semester when you strategically plan out your classes to allow for time to have a job. For example taking 4 classes Mon, Wed and Fri and 1 class on Tues and Thurs will free you up to work and have time to study. Utilizing this technique allowed me to carry a full load and work some hours to put extra cash in my pocket  Try not to overload yourself and if you find you are, get help from your teachers. That is what they are there for. Anything is possible when you put your mind to it. Good luck! "
How hard is it to balance school and work?," I personally, earned my degree while working full-time. Not only that, I had just given birth to my daughter when I took my finals for my associates degree. Then I started back up towards my bachelor is degree I was pregnant with my second son. I was also hospitalized for an infection within my body and had to have surgery. All while passing my courses. I did not end up with the best GPA, but I completed my degree and can speak to all of those adversities. I currently work 50-60 hours a week, I have three children 6 and younger and I am going back to school this fall to get my Masters Degree! Take it one course at a time if it is easier for you.

How hard is it to balance school and work?," Scheduling is going to be key.

School is about retaining information for your life and career not just the grade! "
How hard is it to balance school and work?," I did the same when I was in college, and while it is not easy, it is definitely something that can be done. My best advice would be to focus on time management. Look at your work and school schedules and see where you can best plan completing school work. Set a plan weekly and schedule it out, and of course you have to balance personal life too so consider that as well. Keep to your schedule as best you can, because of course things will come up and you will have to make adjustments on the fly. Prioritize what needs to be done first so it does not get you behind.

Should I work on the side if I want to follow photography as a profession?,"Hi Jonah,  First I commend you for having done some research on your career choice. I too thought to become a professional photographer but the outlay of money for expensive equipment measured and contrasted against its earning potential dissuaded me from moving forward with it.  That was my experience, my decision. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOURS. Yes, you might have to supplement your income as you get started but depending on your talent, ambition, the type of photography you master and able to sell and your go-get attitude you could be a highly successful and well-paid photographer. You might want to refer to Salary.com as it gives you salary figures based on industry type and geographic location - take the ranges provided as averages. Promotion, networking and raw talent are key - you can grow in skill on any one of these so no need to worry. Be persistent, sell your photography as stock, have an amazing portfolio on Behance, connect and apprentice for famous photographers, know how to process your work (camera -raw in Lightroom, Photoshop or any other good image processing application), get your work in front of as many eyeballs and learn the business (contracts and getting paid). Good luck and send me a link to your online portfolio please."
Should I work on the side if I want to follow photography as a profession?," Unless you have someone to support you, you are very likely to need a job that pays the rent while you build a photography business.  I worked as a social worker for ten years while doing assignments and shooting magazine stories on speculation.  Frankly, the social work job had a lot of leeway to take time off and several weeks of vacation leave which made this possible.  During my first six years in the business, and it is very much a business, I did not show a profit, only sales that proved intent to make a profit.  After ten years I was able to make ends meet and eventually I had a few years with a six-figure income.  I believe my experience was typical three or four decades ago.  I could not be as confident now as the photography industry is in decline (since everyone can now do it with digital equipment).  At least having a steady job while pursuing photography as a career will give you the opportunity to aspire without financial ruin.  Worst that could happen is that you will have a creative and satisfying avocation to pursue on the side. "
Should I work on the side if I want to follow photography as a profession?," Hey Jonah,  Assuming photography is your passion, do whatever you have to do to realize your dream. Many artists have to support their art by working other jobs as they become established. "
What is the best way to save money on college textbooks?,"Congratulations for thinking ahead about ways to cut costs!  Many times you can buy a used textbook for about half the cost of new. Also more books are available online now. You could also buddy up with someone in your class or a friend in a different section of the course and share a book ( if you do this, make sure to agree ahead of time on a study schedule for midterms, finals, &amp; othe tests!). Good luck!"
What is the best way to save money on college textbooks?," I recommend shopping around for your books - check out the used books available at your school book store, but also look online.  If buying online I recommend searching by ISBN vs. title.  The ISBN will make sure you get the correct edition textbook whereas searching by name might accidentally lead you to an older or outdated edition.   "
What job opportunities/prospects and environments are available to someone with a Bachelor is of Science in Applied Psychology?," I have a PhD in Psychology, the degree you need to have to call yourself a psychologist (in most states/countries). Regardless if you work in an office/hospital setting or provide services online, you MUST be licensed. In the US, each state has its own rules about how to become a licensed ""Psychologist"" and about what qualifications are needed to be licensed as  professionals in other human service fields (eg, licensed professional counselor, substance use counseling).     Any sort of BA in psych can get you entry level/support staff jobs at clinics that provide treatment such as advanced behavioral analysis and care for individuals with cognitive disabilities.  You might also be an appealing candidate to work at a crisis line or help with the admissions process at places like substance use treatment facilities. The salaries or hourly rates are not great, so you may want a longer term plan to further your career. However, to understand what these jobs are like, you should have internships or jobs so you can determine if it is worth the time/money for you to pursue the field.      Regarding your online treatment question: any type of treatment received via online or other digital/phone means is referred to as ""telehealth"".  At this time, you can only provide online/phone services to people who reside where you are licensed. For example, if you are licensed in New Jersey,  you  cannot  provide treatment to people who live in other states or in other countries. In addition, you need extensive cultural diversity and sensitivity training to be qualified for any therapy job, but this is very important if you have hopes of working with people of diverse cultures. Psychological approaches are always considered within the context of the group is culture and way of life. In addition to licensing laws, there are many other restrictions on how telehealth can be provided. Good luck, and ask your professors/teachers for advice! "
What job opportunities/prospects and environments are available to someone with a Bachelor is of Science in Applied Psychology?, Depending on the state you live in you could do therapeutic staff support work for children with emotional and/or behavioural disorders/syndromes in most public schools. The hiring organization will likely cover the costs of any required trainings our certifications to do so beyond your degree. I got such a job prior to graduation with a pending BA in psychology with a focus on psychopathology. 
What job opportunities/prospects and environments are available to someone with a Bachelor is of Science in Applied Psychology?,"I have a BA in Psychology and was able to work with homeless folks and do case management. Anything beyond that required a license to be reimburseable by insurance, including Medicaid and Medicare.. And in many states you cannot get licensed as a Psychologist without getting a Doctorate degree. So I got a Masters in Social Work and got licensed as a social worker. I can now do therapy in an office setting, in the member is home setting and through telehealth."
"As a creative moving from a small town to a large city, what is the most important use of my time this summer?"," Hi Charles, Yes, you have got a very practical and reliable plan for the future. How to take care of yourself. And then save money. Learning when you enjoy writing is also very important. Establish a routine every day. Reading the best scripts also will help.

"As a creative moving from a small town to a large city, what is the most important use of my time this summer?"," I would say the best way to use your time is research the city itself.

"As a creative moving from a small town to a large city, what is the most important use of my time this summer?"," Hi Charles,    My advice would be to spend your free time doing the stuff you enjoy - whether that is learning to cook, or play a musical instrument, visit with friends, go for a run, or re-watch your favorite movies. If you are working, and saving money, and planning to go to school, that free time is important recharging time for your creative batteries. Of course, it is also good to have life skills - you will need groceries and a balanced budget all your life - but it is really important to do the things that make you feel rested, recharged and able to be creative.

Is college as hard as they say it is?," Hi Imani,     I think the hardest part of college is learning how to manage your time well. There are a lot of student activities, parties, campus life activities, campus jobs and much more that you can participate in throughout your college years. If you failed to manage your time well, you may find yourself starting to struggle in your classes. It is also very important to always remember to prioritize your classes when it comes to managing your time. Many college professors will not give you cookie-cutter instructions for everything, you might be confused and it will be best for you to let them know when you have a problem, question, or a concern right away. Learning to manage your time well would definitely help you stay on track with all your classes.     In regards to if you are worry about struggling to understand the concept of your classes, there are some options available on campus to help you besides meeting your professors during their office hours. Most campuses offer many resources in the library, as well as free tutoring services to their students. Furthermore, you could also form a study group with your classmates or friends to help you stay focus in college.  Time management skills are essential to achieve academic success! I hope this answer helps. Good luck in everything!    "
Is college as hard as they say it is?," Yes. For some people. The freedom can be overwhelming. My nextdoor neighbors were always closely supervised by their parents, who structured all their time for them. They went away for college, and did not know how to deal with it. If you already know how to manage your time, how to say ""no"" when your friends want you to go do something but you do not have time, etc, you will do okay.  You need to be focused on the objective.      Academically, if you already have good study skills, you should be fine. If you have never had to study for anything, and everything came easy to you in high school, you are in for a surprise (this is what happened to me!) Stay caught up with the assignments, take notes rather than relying on the professor is powerpoint handouts, use the resources the school provides to help with studying.  Learn and practice healthy eating, sleeping, and exercise habits - they help the brain to function!       ~Best of Luck! Kim~ "
What is the difference between consulting and investment banking?,"Hi Parker,  An example for a merger based on my own personal experience would be. X Investment Bank works on a merger between Company X and Y in the Mining industry. The Investment Bank identifies this is the possible value creation and this is how you should structure the deal.  Company X and Y is happy with the deal structure and then hires a consulting firm to help the process go forward. E.g. How do we make our supply chain run seamlessly together? How many people do we need to have in both of our firms now that we are combined? How do we get rid of duplication etc;  Banks tend to focus on the more higher strategy side of the value chain, While consultants will generally help with the implementation side in this case."
What is the difference between consulting and investment banking?,"Hi Parker,   I believe the responses above mine have done a great job of covering the work related differences, so I will focus my answer around personal experience and cultural differences between the two paths.  I would say that consulting has a friendly culture whereas investment banking can be more competitive, however both career paths are full of exceptionally smart and kind people. Additionally, I see the largest difference between the two industries to be that consulting has a heavy travel burden, while investment banking has a heavy burden of hours worked. In consulting you can expect to travel Monday to Thursday and have some time off in evenings whereas in investment banking you can often expect to be working near every hour Monday to Thursday but will always be in your home city.   These are, however, broad level generalizations from my experiences. The reality is that every single firm is different for consulting and investment banking. There are consulting firms where you will never travel and investment banks where you work 9am - 5pm. To accurately understand what you want out of these career paths I would recommend networking in the ways I have outlined in the next steps.  "
What is the difference between consulting and investment banking?,"Hi Parker,   To put it simply - Consulting is on any topic - so there can be Financial, Merger &amp; Acquisition, Organizational &amp; HR,  Strategy, Technology, etc. while Investment Banking,  is a specific type of banking.   Going into consulting or investment banking is a great start to one is career. The hours in both of these careers are long, learning is fast and so people need to be quick learners. If you have experience in either industry, in my experience, you can do just about anything you set your mind to.   Good luck. "

What degree is better to have?," My advice would be comp sci, though I may be a bit biased.  I have separate undergraduate degrees in all three of these (Bachelor of Electrical Engineering, B CompE, and BS in Computer Science), and work professionally as a software 'engineer' which is most closely related to computer science.  (I say 'engineer' because it really does not feel like engineering yet, still a young field)   Imo the work available with a comp sci degree is more varied and interesting, but when it comes down to it all of the three are going to be solving technical problems.  In EE or CompE you will likely be solving technical problems much farther away from any end user, but there is also a lot of comp sci positions that do not deal with anything directly user-facing too.   Also, figure out whether or not you like programming, math, etc before you seriously dive into any of the three fields - you may not end up liking it (or maybe you will, who knows). "
What degree is better to have?," Certainly in Silicon Valley a CS degree is the most common and arguably the most useful degree--almost everything here is software. Some schools (e.g., UC Berkeley) have combined EE/CS departments, and it is my impression that double majors in those two are fairly common. (My own degrees are physics-related, so I do not have personal experience. I do work as a software engineer, however, despite never having taken a real computer-science course in my life, and I regularly interview candidates and am at least peripherally involved in hiring decisions.)     There are at least a couple other questions on this site that describe the differences between the three fields in detail (with links to additional info), so you should search for them. From memory, computer engineering has to do with building computers and related devices; electrical engineering is more about building the electronic components in such things, including CPUs, memory, and support chips (though there is a subfield devoted to analog devices, which includes radio-bases subsystems like Bluetooth, WiFi, and cell/mobile); and CS is nominally the science of data structures, algorithms, computability, information, etc., but also encompasses software engineering.

Is being a software engineer a good job for the future?," well here i have described why you should become software developer :   Here are just a few mentions why you should consider a career in software development. The main reasons are:    1) Creative work:   If you want to know about creative jobs, they will mention about writer, musician or painter. But only a few people realize that software development is also a very creative way of life. It is by definition creative since you design new functionality which never existed. The solutions can be expressed in several ways, both in structure and in details. Often there are things to make (for instance speed versus memory usage). And the solution must be correct. And everything needs creativity.   2) Quite in demand:   None can deny that.More and more everywhere is making use of software, or as Marc Andreessen says: “Software is Eating the World“. To mention as there are more programmers, demand is yet pacing out the supply. Software companies say that one of their greatest challenges is finding good developers. Though there is enough competition between employees, there is also huge competition between the employers to get the finest programming minds.   3)Collaborative:   Another myth is that developers sit alone at their technical box and code the entire day. But software development is rather always a team effort. You have to discuss programming issues and bring out solutions with your colleagues, and discuss the needs and other issues with the product managers, testers and also the customers. It is also to be said that pair-programming is popularly done.     Click Here to Read Full Article :  Career Guidance: Why To become A Software Developer  "
Is being a software engineer a good job for the future?," Speaking from the telecom industry, one of the buzzwords these days is SDN (Software-Defined Networking) or SON (Software-Optimized Networking). You can probably guess what that means: Software, not humans, are going to be figuring out how to configure the network for best performance. That means my industry is going to need more and more programmers, and fewer electrical engineers.     So yes, in the foreseeable future, software engineering is an excellent career choice. BUT... do not think technical skills are all you will need. Collaboration with other humans as software requirements are defined and software is built, deployed, and maintained is also a core skill. So also spend some time learning to ""play well with others"". "

If you want financial reward, learn to understand the business problems you can solve with technology.  In either case, it is important to understand who you are and what is your purpose on this planet.  Follow that and you can not go wrong."

can you own your Hospital if you are a nurse?,"  Note: I am speaking for the United States only (the hospital industry differs greatly around the world).     Individual people almost never own hospitals. Because of the huge investment required to build or buy a functional hospital, and the legal requirements the hospital must meet, they are usually owned by large companies or are not owned at all. In the United States, roughly two-thirds of the hospitals are non-profit organizations without any owners, and other third is split evenly between government hospitals and for-profit hospitals owned and operated by large professional companies. (I do not have a source for these numbers, so please do some research to check this before relying on it). A good example for a for-profit hospital management company is Tenet.    I am interested in understanding what you like about owning a hospital and what you like about being a Nurse. They are each very very different activities, and it is exceptionally unlikely that you could do both   at the same time  . Being a nurse will bring certain types of experiences, and will require years of nurse training, whereas managing (not owning) a hospital will require business accumen built from years of management training. You could certainly do both, but I can not imagine how you could be able to train to do both at once, nor would you be able to fulfill your nurse duties (which is a full-time job with a demanding schedule). If you would like to be a nurse but want to have some small ownership stake in a hospital company, you could become a nurse and use your savings to purchase shares of Tenet or another similar company on the stock market, which would give you a small ownership stake in the hospital industry without being a hospital manager.    If you would like to clarify, please do so in a comment or re-edit your question, or ask a new question!      Good luck - Jared from the CareerVillage Team   "

Whats the difference in a nurse practioner and a physicans assistant?," Over the last two decades, several new medical and healthcare professions have been created to keep up with the need for specialized health care. Two such healthcare professions are that of a physician assistant and nurse practitioner.    Both of these professions are somewhat similar, with only subtle differences between them. This close similarity in job descriptions often poses a problem, as many people find it difficult to differentiate between the two specialties. This article helps you understand the two specialties in detail and clears up any existing confusion between them.  Both physician assistants and nurse practitioners require a formal degree of education and both are trained to take care of the ill and deliver healthcare to those in need. While at first glance they may appear to be similar, there are some differences between the two professions which mainly relate to the type of education that each profession requires.   Nurse Practitioner: A nurse practitioner, or NP, is essentially a more academically advanced and experienced registered nurse. In fact, a registered nurse acquires a nurse practitioner certification when he or she advances from a bachelor’s degree (BN) to a master’s or doctoral degree and qualifies through a national exam. Nurse practitioners must follow through with continued education and recertify after a certain number of years. Nurse practitioners may also need to apply for additional responsibilities at the state level.   Physician Assistant (PA): A physician assistant, or PA, must also earn a master’s degree. After this, a physician assistant must qualify by taking a national certification exam, called the PANCE, and practice under a trained physician. Physician assistants must also pursue continued education and state licensure. In addition, PA’s have to recertify after a certain amount of time through another examination, which is called the PANRE.   Nurse Practitioner vs. Physician Assistant One major difference between the two professions is the type of education required. Whereas physician assistants qualify through a more general medical examination, called the PANCE, and are not required to complete a residency, nurse practioners generally qualify through an exam more specific to population of focus, such as pediatrics or geriatrics, and have practical experience as BNs before qualifying. Usually, NPs and PAs are both able to diagnose and treat illness in addition to prescribe medication; however, nurse practitioners may have to apply on the state level for certain additional responsibilities, such as prescribing medication.   Another difference between the practice of physician assistants and nurse practitioners is that a physician assistant must practice under the supervision of a physician. Although pysician assistants, or PAs, may be able to perform certain duties on their own, they do this under the authority of their supervising physician. On the other hand, nurse practitioners may have more independence in that they can carry out some tasks in providing healthcare and assistance independently, without supervision by a physician, depending upon state laws, level of education, and additional certifications and qualifications achieved.   Because physician assistants have to work in sync with a qualified physician, the number of hours they work is more closely related to that of their supervising physician. On the other hand, nurse practitioners may have more autonomy in that regard. Since, in some states, nurse practitioners can work solo, nurse practitioners can decide when and for how long they work. If their work is not dependant on any other medical professional, they will have more discretion as to their own professional lives and routine. "
How will I know how to set up majors and minors?," The first step is getting to know yourself better to develop a career focus and then talking with people who are doing what you think that you want to do to see what they do, how they got there, and what suggestions and advice that they might have for you.     Getting to know yourself and how your personality traits relate to people involved in various career opportunities is very important in your decision making process. During my many years in Human Resources and College Recruiting, I ran across too many students who had skipped this very important step and ended up in a job situation which for which they were not well suited. Selecting a career area is like buying a pair of shoes. First you have to be properly fitted for the correct size, and then you need to try on and walk in the various shoe options to determine which is fits the best and is most comfortable for you to wear. Following are some important steps which I developed during my career which have been helpful to many .    "
Career vs Passion?," Andres,     It is not an either/or question! Ideally, you would look at where the two overlap. Passion is great, but, it often does not pay the bills! You also want to look at how you define success. If you are one of those people who need the fancy car and big house, and it has to be bigger than your brother is house, and your brother is a doctor, well. . . .you know where that story ends! But, if ""success"" means you live in a decent neighborhood, can pay all your bills, save towards retirement, buy new clothes for your kids, meet unexpected expenses, etc., then it is a lot easier to attain success! You really want to think about this now, so, when you achieve success, you will know that you have!     If you can realistically expect to achieve success by following your passion, then you go for it. An example would be someone who likes to create computer games, or design robotics. However, if your passion is making pottery, that would be more difficult.  But, if you also like working with people, you could look at getting into rehabilitative therapy, where pottery might be one of many techniques used. Or, becoming a museum curator where there are a lot of pottery exhibits. Or an archaeologist. It all just sort of depends.      It is also possible to become passionate about a career, even though right now it might be something you never studied before. I will say this: Do not pursue something you totally hate! If you can not stand playing with numbers all day, do not go into accounting, even if you are good at it!!!! Just because you are good at something does not mean it is the right thing for you!     Sorry this is sort of rambling, but, I hope I have said something to help you think this through. If you have particular careers and passions you want to mention, I might be able to see how the two go together and give you some more ideas!     Kim "
Career vs Passion?," The goal in life is to look forward to going to work every day and feeling a sense of accomplishment and fulfilment in your work.

Career vs Passion?," Hey Andres! This is a tough question and you should not have to sacrifice one for the other.&nbsp; However nobody wants to be in a position where they are trying to make a career out of something that does not spark their passion. Make a list of everything you are passionate about, then make another list next to that with all the careers that interests you. Once you have both lists made look for common ground between the careers and the passions that you have listed. Doing this will allow you to see how your passions correlate with your career interests.  "
Career vs Passion?," Great question! I was raised in a different generation where finding a career was paramount to following your passion. What is so great about the advancements in technology is that so many doors are open to you to find and pursue your passion and make it a career! The way to best ensure a fulfilling career as an adult is to find a way to make a living from doing what you love.  Your passions are typically determined by your personality and interests.  Figure out what you are passionate about and then look at where there is a need in that space.  This can help you determine what skills you need to build to follow that passion.  The key is to take advantage of the technology at your fingertips. There has never been an easier time to research your interests and make an informed decision about your future. There are so many non-traditional pursuits that you can follow, however you will need traditional skills to realize those pursuits. Leverage your educational goals to match the skill set required to follow your passion. "
Career vs Passion?," That is an incredible question, Andres.  I believe that nearly everyone would like to have their career BE their passion, but that is not always possible.  Only you can decide the balance of career vs. passion.    The good news is... it IS possible to have a career and pursue your passions at the same time.  Hopefully you can make your career something that you like to do and you do it well.  That is perfect.  Your career helps you live a comfortable life and can allow you to pursue your true passions  ""on the side"".   Travel, join organizations, volunteer, build a workshop for your hobby...  whatever that passion is, do not abandon it for your career.    And you never know, your passion may become a second career later after you are established and feel more comfortable with making it your next career. "
Career vs Passion?," This is a great question because I see so many people only look at a career that is a ""smart"" choice instead of something they are truly passionate about that may pay less.  I am a believer that there are ways to have both. For instance, I know of someone who teaches piano lessons because they loved it but also started teaching videos on YouTube and makes great money.  If you really want to do something that brings you joy you can get creative in different ways to make more money.  You got this!  "
Career vs Passion?," I will tell you, as you can see from the many answers, that many of us can relate to this question. Many of us have been there and chose what we thought were best for each of us. I will say, enjoying what you do makes a huge difference in the effort you will put in on a daily basis. I definitely believe in being able to do both and finding that happy medium between the two if you can not. In more recent times, you can pretty much turn any passion into a career so spending sometime on figuring how to make it work is worth it. "

"What college or university can I attend for illustration and/or cartooning, that does not require SAT or ACT scores, and also has dorms?"," It is been awhile since I was applying to colleges, and I am  not sure I have all the info to answer your question, but here goes.  To be a comic book artist you need art skills and experience, ideas, creativity, and a well rounded education.  So, in my opinion, that means a degree from a 4 year college or university with a major in art or illustration.   I think most schools do require SAT scores for admission. If your scores are really low, you might think about retaking them.  However, how important the scores are in relation to your GPA, references, extra curricula activities, etc. is something that differs amongst colleges, so do not worry if yours are not that great.   To find schools that do not require SAT is  for admission, I would just google the question you asked above ""Colleges or Universities that do not require SAT scores"" and see what pops up. I know George Washington University in Washington DC just announced they are not using them for admission.   I am thinking most art schools are more interested in your portfolio than your SAT scores, so you have a head start there already. I am also thinking that if you have a stellar art portfolio, that could help to counter low SAT scores in applying for 4 year colleges; do not let low SAT scores hold you back from applying to colleges.     As for the dorm living situation, I would get one of those books that list and describe colleges; there are online sources for this too. Visit your local library or school library and ask the librarian for help on finding these resources.  Check with your High School Guidance Office or Career Center, if you have one.  Also, have you discussed this with your high school guidance counselor?  That would be a great place to start.   "
"What college or university can I attend for illustration and/or cartooning, that does not require SAT or ACT scores, and also has dorms?"," Hi, Rita. Earlier today I responded to a similar question about colleges with comics programs. I have not personally attended Savannah College of Art and Design, but its Sequential Art program is well-known throughout the comics industry, and seems to generate a lot of very talented artists. A quick search reveals the following about SAT scores and SCAD: ""SAT or ACT scores are not required of non-U.S. applicants. Domestic applicants who have been graduated from high school two or more years at the time their file is reviewed for admission are not required to submit test scores."" Hope this helps! If I were you, the first thing I think I would do is find a list of colleges with exciting programs and try contacting their admissions departments to have a person-to-person conversation about the specifics of how you might enter even if you are missing SAT scores. I have to imagine many would be open to working with you on your unique situation. Direct contact never hurts--at least you learn something from it! Good luck! "

"What college or university can I attend for illustration and/or cartooning, that does not require SAT or ACT scores, and also has dorms?"," Hi :-D   I come from Europe I cannot tell you details about the education system here. The art-school I attended in Sydney (National Art School)  asked for a folio, had an on-site drawing test, and interviews.  High grades would not get anyone in; they looked for evidence of talent, some skill... and commitment. But actually a lot of the students there were high achievers academically as well.   In my career I met educated people, but also self-taught. I suggest you find your heroes... those people doing what you want to do, those that inspire you and create things you relate to. Try to find out how they got where they are... Their CV/ bio might be on the net. Where they came from might be a good place to go?   Then I say... draw, draw and draw :-D Anything... binge in animals, human figure, plants, buildings... get the visual library into your system.  Look up things like dramaturgy, creative writing... to make you a good storyteller you need to know things about narrative techniques and visual communication.  Some global University even have FREE internet classes in topics like this.    I worked as illustrator some years BEFORE I got my formal degree and also as Art-Director.

What are the chances of being a successful freelance Computer scientist?," There are plenty of opportunities to work as a freelance software developer. There are lots of contract software development opportunities available. Just look at one of the contract hiring boards, like dice.com or craigslist, to get a feel for the variety of assignments out there.  It is a bit of work to break into this field: once you have some projects under your belt and a track record of success, it is easier to get more work. It might make sense for you to work as a salaried employee for a few years to get some experience.   It is also helpful to pitch yourself as a specialist in something people need. So-called ""line of business"" web applications (custom applications for particular business purposes) can be an excellent way to position yourself.   ""Computer scientist"" in the working world usually refers to a university professor or member of technical staff in a research organization. Many computer scientists have PhD degrees and are motivated by pushing the boundaries of knowledge.

Are you looking to be a freelance CS, because you want work-life balance or personal freedom, ....?  Depending upon your personal reason, that will define what ""successful"" means.  Does success = freedom, so that you can ride along the Rideau Canal or does success = $$$, so that you will be able to travel/dine first class, etc.   Regardless of what your definition of success is, you will find that freelance work will be hard to come by for someone who just graduated from school with minimal to no on the job experience.  To be ""successful"" you will need to build up your experience and project portfolio so that you can land freelance jobs.  So to set yourself up for success, I would recommend that you find an employer (1st job) whose culture matches your criteria for success so that you do not feel like you gave up on your dream of freelancing.   Best of luck to you. "

Is an game developers job hard ?,"It depends on what you mean by, ""hard.""  Are the hours long? Yes.  Does it require specialized skills? Yes.  Is it physically grueling? No (unless you count sleep deprivation).  Is it emotionally draining? No (unless you are working on games that conflict with your personal beliefs).  I agree with Ed is response that you should figure out what you are good at and study related skills. Broadly, game developers fall into one of four categories:  1) Artists: skills include pixel art, 3D modeling, animation (2D and 3D), graphic design  2) Software engineers: skills include programming, software systems design, database design, mathematics  3) Game designers: skills include writing, economics, mathematics (understanding programming helps)  4) Producers: skills include project management, scheduling, budgeting, and team management  But, mostly, if you love games, you should start making them. It does not matter if you program them on a computer or make them out of paper, start building something. This will help you understand what you love to do and will naturally lead you to the right skills to study for your personal interests. Also, understand that modern games -- especially video games -- are not built by individuals. They take teams of people multiple years to complete -- at least, the AAA console and PC titles. So do not get discouraged if your games do not look and feel like Overwatch or Divinity: Original Sin.  "
Is an game developers job hard ?,"One word answer ""Yes"".  Some people think it is as easy as playing games, but a lot of hard work goes into it.  When I used to each game development I saw a lot of students fall by the wayside.  Now are you afraid of a little hard work.  If so, pick another career.  There are plenty of others that will put in the extra time to make an excellent game rather than just slapping something together that you probably would not even buy yourself.   Now that being said, I have been doing it for years and am past retirement age, and am probably older than 99% of the game developers I run into.  I could easily retire.  I saved plenty of money, but I think it is the best job int he world, so why would I quit, when I can have fun making new games...  Hope that helps give you some perspective.  --Ed Magnin"

What is the best part of being an engineer?," Damyon, you have 2 questions here.  First, for me, the best part of being a mechanical engineer is that I am always learning, creating, and working with a wide variety of talented people.  I have been in product development for a long time.  There are always new challenges in the devices that I help develop and in the technology that we are creating and using to develop the products.  I have also had the chance with work with people from all over the world here in the US and on site in their facilities.       Regarding why you should pick mechanical engineering over another career, that is a very personal question for you.  Above, I told you why I like being a mechanical engineer.  You have to decide if that is a good fit for you.  I strongly believe that you should get an education that you are not only passionate about, but one that can provide you with skills to take you on your career path that you are also passionate about.  Mechanical Engineering is a broad degree within engineering and can be applied in many different ways.       You are very smart to consider this early and pick the right career path.  I have thoughts below on how to pick. "
Is it better to go to a community college before a university or four year college?," Hartasia,     As an academic advisor for STEM students at a 4-year institution, I see a lot of transfer students coming from community colleges.   The only advantage that I see in going to community college first is cost - i.e. if you are paying out of pocket or through a loan,  community college can be cheaper.  Yet, depending on the major you want to pursue, community college might not be your best choice for cost saving.       If you are seeking to do a STEM major, or any major where there is a strict course sequence chain, you will probably need to start with your STEM classes from your very first semester if you want to graduate as quickly as possible.  The strategy of taking your general education courses first and then transferring to a 4-year university does not work for all majors.  Students who transfer in some STEM majors from community college may end up being eligible to take only a couple of classes per semester for one, two or three semesters, thus prolonging their path to graduation.  For example, at my school all computing majors start with Programming I and Programming II, and until a student completes Programming II, they cannot take any other classes in their major.  In the end, it may end up being more expensive, not cheaper to start at community college. So it really depends on the major you want to pursue and what the specific community college can offer in terms of classes counting towards this major.     Another consideration is the rigor of the classes offered by the community college.  For example, we often have students come in with Programming I and II credit from community colleges, only to find out that what they learned at their courses does not match the depth/breadth of the classes at our institution, i.e. they find themselves unprepared for the higher level courses that have Programming II as a prerequisite.  Thus, again, it is a matter of researching what a particular community college offers in terms of your academic and career goals.     If your chief motivation for starting at a community college is cost-cutting, there are other ways to do that.  Many colleges accept CLEP https://clep.collegeboard.org/ credits to satisfy general education requirements;  Students can complete free online classes to prepare for the CLEP exams offered by the nonprofit Modern States https://modernstates.org/ , who also offer vouchers to cover the cost of the exam itself.   I routinely recommend this option to my advisees.     I would recommend that you meet with an academic advisor from the 4-year institution that you may be interested in to discuss your plans and path - they should be able to guide you. "
Is it better to go to a community college before a university or four year college?," Hi Hartasia! I’m sorry no one’s answered your question yet. We are working hard to get it answered by Professionals with the best insights, but in the meantime I have included a link to a relevant Q&amp;A here on CareerVillage.org that should be super helpful for you to read through.     Tyler asked:  What are the benefits of going to community college before transferring to a university? , and one of the Pros who answered it said:      There are several benefits to going to a community college before transferring to a university. The biggest and most obvious is cost. A university will require the same core classes offered in a community college setting that you complete the first 2 years. You can realize a significant savings in tuition and room and board by going to a community college. Several states have programs that allow students to attend community college for little or no money at all Many also work full time as they attend community college, saving money to put towards their University education...

"If I want to be a coach, should I start at the youth level?","Hello Derek - I have run a non-profit youth basketball club for over 13 years.  I believe the youth level is a great way to start into coaching to improve your skills and help you decide if it can be your passion.  As a coach you are a leader, mentor and role model.  If you find it is not your passion then take a different career route.  Volunteering is a great way to break into an organization an show your value.  My top coach that I trust with our 2 travel teams started with me many years ago as a volunteer.  He showed he was willing to make a personal investment of his time to become a better coach and that went a long way with impressing me.  Good luck and enjoy the ride!"

How does a master degree affect your career and pay?," Hi Ayomide,   Interesting question...I think different career fields value master is degrees differently.   While I do not have any experience with the Accounting profession, I did a bit of research to see if a Master is for an Accountant would make a difference in career and pay. My findings, no.  Getting your CPA would be much more advantageous.    Reference these two articles:  http://fortune.com/2016/03/21/best-worst-graduate-degrees-jobs-2016/:    and this article about accounting specifically:  http://gazettereview.com/2017/03/average-cpa-salary-much-cpas-make/   Best to you!

How does a master degree affect your career and pay?," I got a Masters in Business taxation and because of that I understand more of the tax rules and I learned how to do tax research.  So in that way it is helped me in my career at PwC as a Tax Associate.   Also, I got a 4k higher starting salary because of it.     Another benefit was that because I took a year to get my Masters I was able to use that time to pass all the CPA exams before I started working (I took three during my spring semester and one between graduating with my MBT and starting work).   As I watch a lot of my coworkers struggle to balance work and the CPA exam I am so glad I am already done.  Regardless of whether you get a Masters, I would highly recommend becoming a CPA since so many more options are open for CPAs. "
How does a master degree affect your career and pay?, It would vary depending on what job in accounting you are looking for. I know from my experience working in Audit for PricewaterhouseCoopers that a Masters degree does not impact my career or salary. However getting the CPA does have a large impact on career/salary.  For some of my friends in the Tax practice getting a Masters was beneficial to their career/salary. Since accounting is a broad field determining what you want to do with your accounting degree will help determine whether getting a Masters is a good idea for you. 
How does a master degree affect your career and pay?,"I think the big concern here is the 150 credits to fulfill the CPA requirement.

"If an educated population is very important, why are teachers in the US not respected (and trusted) as much as they are in other countries?"," During my professional career and training I have had a number of mentors from other countries and have seen how academicians are treated in other countries.    The  best answer to your question was one given to me when I was an undergraduate.  Education is seen as a good second job.  Meaning it is a good job for a woman to supplement the household income of a husband that is the major bread winner.   You also have state legislatures that speak down to educators because it is an expensive of the state budget.  Heck, in Texas, they balanced the state is budget by taking $5.6 billion away from public education but cut business taxes.  But public school administrators also look down on teachers.  I was admonished during a meeting when I suggested that a student of mine exhibited characteristics of having cerebral palsy.  The principal stood corrected when the mother told her that the family neurologist just diagnosed her that morning with cp.  Not three weeks later she was walking in the hall with her brother, a medical doctor, that stopped me and shook my hand.  He told his sister that I was his ""neuro"" professor in medical school.  She was unaware I also was an adjunct professor at two different universities.   Though I enjoy teaching at upper level universities, the public school population is the one I love and if you love what you are doing everything else happens.  But I will add, you have to be active in politics because they will continue to dump on you and you should not have to take it.  "
"If an educated population is very important, why are teachers in the US not respected (and trusted) as much as they are in other countries?"," Thank you for this question.  As an educator, I am saddened by this way of thinking in America.  Of course there are a plethora of reasons why this is the case; however, in my opinion, I believe that since there are so many jobs (and...well-paying jobs at that) which can be secured without a formal education, the idea of education itself, as well as teachers, are no longer respected.  Nowadays, teachers are unfortunately seen more often as ""babysitters"" who happen to teach children.   The emphasis has shifted from actually educating children to maintaining student behavior and having children in a safe place while mommy and daddy goes to work.   It is not that teachers have stopped teaching, it is just that society does not view teaching as a prestigious career...often due to the low pay that teachers get.  This is why teachers teach because they have a passion or desire to affect lives, and do not teach for the money.  And, for this...society should be more grateful. "
What is the best advice you can give an aspiring lawyer about to start college?," Hello there, future fellow lawyer. I am a lawyer and would like to share some advice from an academic, professional and personal perspective.     First, speaking of academic achievement, take some classes in political theory and philosophy. Try to take classes that involve a lot of reading and helping you develop analytical skills. Second, professionally speaking, try to get an internship or some part-time work as a paralegal so you can meet real lawyers and see what it likes to be one. Third, think about your personal goals and why you want to be a lawyer. Are you looking into criminal or corporate law? Or maybe litigation? These are all types of law but they are very, very different. Think about your own personality and what makes you happy. Not everyone enjoys going to court and litigating. Some people are really afraid of taking criminal cases. Others prefer reviewing contracts. Try to meet people who have done different things and get a taste of each of these. "
What is the best advice you can give an aspiring lawyer about to start college?," From an academic perspective, I suggest seeking out college classes that will help you develop critcal thinking, writing skills and presentation/public speaking skills.   In my experience, this is far more important than your college major -- unless perhaps you decide to go into an area of law for which expertise in a particular field would help (for example, if you decided you really wanted to practice sports law, you might want to major in -- or even just take some classes in -- sports management).      I also suggest getting as much law-related work experience as you can -- whether in internships or paid positions.  This will help you focus your career preferences and also bolster your law school application (in case you do decide to apply).  It is a good idea to visit the internship and career counseling departments at your college early on.  Also, look at law school admission requirements now, so you know what to expect and can focus on becoming a desirable applicant.  Law school admissions and the legal profession are very competitive, so gather as much information as you can now in order to (a) evaluate your interest, and (b) begin to think strategically about how to navigate law school and a career.       Good luck!  "
What is the best advice you can give an aspiring lawyer about to start college?,"My advice to you is take things one step at a time.  That is great that you have an end goal in mind.  However, you will need to focus on the immediate future first.  You can look at the classes at your university to determine what interests you and what would be beneficial towards a legal career.  For example, you may be interested in political science or government.  Those type of courses lend themselves to legal careers as you would learn how laws are made.  Try to figure out what you most enjoy doing and why you are interested in the legal field.  Talk to anyone you know that may be in the legal field about their experiences and to see if they have suggestions.  You want to make sure that it is really worth the financial and time commitment. Good luck. #legal #law "

"If i want to get my PHD, and I am graduating from High School this year, how and when should I begin to study for the MCAT is?"," The MCAT is are for admission to medical school; normally you would take them in your junior year (but perhaps after your sophomore year, depending upon the course work completed thus far).   Most universities have advisors who specialize in advising students who want to go to medical school.  Psychiatrists indeed have the M.D. degree.   The Ph.D. degree requires taking the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) and not the MCAT.   Yes, you can obtain a Ph.D. (which is essentially a research based degree) and an M.D. - but you will be spending most of your young adulthood in school ... psychologists get Ph.D. is or Psy.D is.   Many high school students get these two, closely related disciplines confused.   If you have additional questions, do not hesitate to contact me directly through LinkedIn.  Good luck. "
"If i want to get my PHD, and I am graduating from High School this year, how and when should I begin to study for the MCAT is?"," When I entered undergraduate my major was Pre-med and everything was geared towards entering medical school.  I changed my major in my junior year and went a different route into Counseling.     Bravo for wanting to pull the non medical, yet clinical application of psychology into your work as a psychiatrist!  So I would go for the tougher degree first - medical school.  So gear  all of your coursework and activities towards medicine with an flavor of psychology.  This way, if you happen to enjoy something else more in medical school you have the skills and knowledge to refocus your efforts.  Once you have your MD and are a practicing psychiatrist you can then decide (and will have more information) on how much coursework you want to take in the realm on clinical psychology.     I have had friends go for the MD and find they love the mix of neurology and neuroscience with psychiatry, and add a specialty PhD in neuroscience to round out their practice.   Give yourself some room for flexibility and this will allow the best choices for you to appear! "
"If i want to get my PHD, and I am graduating from High School this year, how and when should I begin to study for the MCAT is?"," First, to become a psychiatrist, you need an MD, not a PhD.

You seem very focused.  you will do just fine!  "
What is a good programming community?," A community is the place where people feel that they belong, fit in, are cared for, and a place where they feel important. A community with computers could and would be several choices for you to ponder.    Communities are groups of individuals helping one another either by remote desktop or that are directly in the same arena or venue. Since we are a cyber world remote sharing and desktop are becoming part of the community and sharing as part of the computer norm. Such as communications of email blogs etc. :   •   Participation in some  common practices together depend on one another make good decisions together as a community. A community relies on teams to help one another. If you are seeking a community of programmers I would suggest going into computer sciences and find your niche with computer science. Have you figured out what you want to do with computers yet? What type of computations that interest you could be?  Do you want to program? Do you want to do Tech support? Networking? Why or why not are you interested in a community of computer individuals? Do you mean like in gaming? Do you like computer animation? There so many factions for you to choose from where many people such as yourself would be in the same field that you are suggesting in computer sciences. This depends on whom you want to work for? How much college that you want to invest in for the future of your potential career? This sounds like to me you want to work with other people like yourself in the same business? This is an easy task. Computer programmers, and computer admins, computer security are in high demand in our current economy globally. You would not have difficulty landing a job in the field of computer technology of any   sorts there are many communities that offer great jobs like google or major computer companies like Facebook too that all sit in front of computers all day and I am very sure they would be happy to help you along. I hope this has helped on your journey into the cyber world. Have you figured out what you want to do yet as far as computers go? Fixing a computer is hardware and some software.  Programming is actual code and some mathematics, learning code, writing code. There is Cisco, Java, and so many more programs for you to learn.  "
What is a good programming community?," StackOverflow is a definite, as noted above.  I will also suggest ""Meetup.com"" and ""Open source"".     I am a big fan of Meetup.com. These are typically open meetings with an interesting speakers, possibly pizza, and definitely the chance to chat in person with interesting people worth knowing.     A search on meetup.com for ""Software"" in your area shows ""Gulf Coast Software Testers"", http://www.meetup.com/gulfcoasttesters/.   And if there is any group that can help you learn about good dev, its testers.    If you find any open source project that interests you, there are likely many ways to contribute to the code, docs, issues list, release, testing, etc.  that will build the project, your skills, your network and your rep.     Seconding another answer above, contributing is the best way to be part of the community and pretty much every OSS project has ways to contribute:   http://blog.smartbear.com/programming/14-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-being-a-programming-genius-or-a-rock-star/       Short answer:  join GitHub and learn how to create software tests and pull requests, and you will be welcome in many projects with increasing chances to contribute and build your skills.   Unlike Meetup.com which are in person, OSS communities tend to be virtual. "
What is a good programming community?," This is a hard question to answer, since, as Holly Waggoner(Di'Angelo) says, a community of this sort could mean many different things.   Stackoverflow is a good place. In addition, there are some chat rooms and mailing lists related to learning specific languages. For example, if you go to python.org , you will notice a ""Community"" link, which has some further suggestions including an IRC channel.   Also, some Open Source projects have distinct communities around them, united by the common goal of improving the piece of software involved. If you do not know much about Open Source I recommend looking into it, as a programmer in general, and the way to get into one of those communities is to find a project you are interested in and start trying to help out. If you do not know much programming yourself, yet, you can start with improving the documentation (which can mean ""writing down what you found was unclear from their instructions""). "

Dentistry or Computer engineering," Hey!      So I am a Software Developer, and I think it was a great choice for me. It may not be right for you but here are somethings I like about it:       1 - It is very easy to self-learn   There are so many resources for Software Developers for free online. Even when I was at University, often courses would be just a few months out of date, and it would make a huge difference. Computer Science is a great field for anyone who likes to explore resources and try things on their own. My impression is that this is really difficult in the medical field, but I have not studied this so I can not be sure.      2 - You can be your own boss    You mention that you want to have your own practice as a dentist, which is awesome! As a reminder, software development in really flexible about this.      You can be your own boss and try to freelance or start a start up. Some people realize running a business is harder than they expected and if that is the case you can work for a larger company like Google or Amazon, or a smaller company like Snapchat or Square, or work for a small start up for 0 - 50 people. There are also lots of opportunities to work for companies that are not even tech companies like Disney, Major League Baseball, or The New York Times where companies are trying to bring technology to other industries.      Computer science is a tool that can be used in lots of ways!      3 - Computer science is a really cool skill to have   On a really basic level, computer science is a really cool skill to have, even if you do not make it your career. Some of the most interesting people in this field are trying to apply software skills to other industries. Tesla is more of a transportation company than a tech company, but software is letting them build cars unlike any traditional car companies. OneMedical is a medical company that is using technology to make appointments and medical care more efficient.           Good luck with your decision. Either way, it sounds like you are looking at some good choices!  "
Dentistry or Computer engineering," I apologize in advance, because this answer will get a bit morbid.     Full disclosure, I work as a programmer and have been active in the industry for over 15 years.  I enjoy this work because it allows me to be creative and solve puzzles (as I am sure you are aware from your post). I enjoy the challenge and the fun of building systems that work and that people use on a daily basis.     We have an emotional component to our decisions, but we should also consider some industry metrics as well.  If you search for terms like ""happiest profession"" or ""most satisfying job"" you will likely see many technology related terms pop up (For example; https://www.careerbliss.com/blog/the-careerbliss-happiest-and-unhappiest-jobs-of-2018/ lists &lt;span style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 102);""&gt;.NET Developer, Sr. Software Developer, and IT Specialist all in the top 10 happiest jobs).  This indicates a possible correlation between software/IT fields and happiness.  Your mileage may vary.&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 102);""&gt;When it comes to dentistry, there are studies that suggest that dentists suffer from higher rates of both suicide and depression.  According to the following article &lt;/span&gt;https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/5344jz/are-dentists-really-more-prone-to-suicide     &lt;span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""&gt;A&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;  2015 study  &lt;span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""&gt;&nbsp;by the American Dental Association showed showed that 11 percent of dentists responding were diagnosed with depression, while the rate for the&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;  general population  &lt;span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""&gt;&nbsp;was 6.7 percent. Six percent of dentists surveyed had an anxiety disorder while only 3.1 percent of the general population did. Four percent of dentists reported panic disorder, while only 2.7 percent of the general population reported the same.&lt;/span&gt;     What I would suggest is to combine your interests in computer science and chemistry/biology.  Biotech is an up and coming field with a lot of opportunities to work with (or possibly invent) exciting new technologies. "
Dentistry or Computer engineering," Hi!     During my undergraduate years at my university I was first a computer engineering major for roughly 2 years. I was always told you attend college to find a career something you are passionate about, if you are passionate in both I would suggest considering a double major. The great thing about doing a double major is that you will already be in the STEM department, so it would not be a heavy load of classes for you which is great!      Personally IT work just was not for me I am a people person so being behind a computer and working on computers just was not going to work out long term for me. Both career paths are considerably paid fairly well. You should look at the pro and the cons of each profession, nothing comes easy in life so do not look for short cuts. Do the work and stay the course that your heart desires, it will always pay off. Both career field are in great need of workers, consider a large part of a generation is retiring they need someone to fill their shoes! Most importantly, someone is going to always need a dentist and someone is always going to need something dealing with a computer you will never go without a job!     I would also urge you to look a  double major and make the best of both worlds, develop tools and software for the dental industry and help bring them into the 21st and 22nd century! It would be ground breaking to see more technology used in the the dentist outside of the normal machines! You could go down in history for your medical device is and even make top dollar for selling them to other dentist! "
Dentistry or Computer engineering," These are two very good, challenging and important  careers.  Comparing the two is not as simple as  looking at annual salary.  First, you can become a computer engineer with a four-year degree.  Your masters degree will likely take another year.  Becoming a dentist will take 7 to 8 years.  There is more competition for spots in dental school, particularly because a computer engineer can generally enter a wider variety of positions in the working world.  The other thing to consider is that being your own boss sounds very attractive, but running a business yourself is quite an undertaking.  As a computer engineer, many of us can simply leave work at the end of the day and forget about it.  Running your own business is a bit more taxing.  Now, from personal experience, I can say that in many of my projects, I was responsible for the original invention and running the project until completion, so my weeks tended to be a lot more time-consuming than the average engineer, so there is significant variability.    Another thing to consider for starting your own practice is startup costs.  Establishing a dental practice can cost 300 to 500 thousand dollars or more.  And, like my own projects, you will be responsible for your staff.  As for salary, it is estimated that the average dentist makes in the 150 thousand range currently.  Salaries for an accomplished computer engineer average approximately 120 thousand, with a bit more variability.  Keep in mind that as a computer engineer, you will typically be working for a company -- possibly a very large company -- that will bear the burden of overhead like office space, insurance, other benefits, etc..  Something to consider in becoming a dentist is that you do not necessarily exclude delving into computers.  Computer engineering touches nearly every profession these days, so a dual undergrad degree has a lot of potential.  One thing to consider for each of these professions is that neither of them will be subject to automation anytime soon.  They will simply benefit from any technology advances.  Both are lucrative and secure professions.   "
Dentistry or Computer engineering," The key is NOT how much you will make, do not even go there.  Pick a field that you ENJOY, because you are going to spend most of the rest of your adult life in this field.   The field you pick should make you excited to go to work every day.  When you are passionate about what you do, success is sure to follow!    "
"I was accepted to a university that was my first choice on my list, but it is also the most expensive, should I accepted anyway and worry about cost later?"," Hi  Victoria,  congratulations on your acceptance.  You may look into asking the University about their transfer of credit policy is.  Perhaps you could start at a community college and receive an associate degree and transfer into the university with your general electives completed.  It is up to the University’s transfer policy and they should be able to assist.  The necessary steps would be to:     Find a lower cost college that offers an associates degree if your major.  Check with the University you want to really attend about transfer credit policies.  Review the information to see what would be the best options for you.    Continue to look for scholarships.   Best Wishes,     Sherri    "
"I was accepted to a university that was my first choice on my list, but it is also the most expensive, should I accepted anyway and worry about cost later?"," Hello Victoria,  I am currently a senior in college majoring in Finance. I was brought up in a household where my mom made very little money (living off of disability checks). The best advice I can give you is for you to go to a community college where you can take your basic classes. I understand this school offers you the opportunity to jump right into your major classes, however the basics are important as well. Before you start taking classes at the community school you need to look up ""Transfer Equivalency."" This is to ensure that your credits will transfer to the other university. If they do not you will have to retake all of your classes which equals more money. Due to the fact that your grandmother makes little money, you will be able to recieve Pell grant which is free money from the government. If you choose to go to a community college, your tuition would be covered with the pell grant.    The typical university expenses:  Tuition (varies on how many credit hours you take a semester)  Meal plan and housing   Textbooks ( Expect to spend anywhere from $100-$500, a semester) NO JOKE!!  School Fees (Athletic fee, residual fee, parking fees, etc) "
"I was accepted to a university that was my first choice on my list, but it is also the most expensive, should I accepted anyway and worry about cost later?"," Victoria,  Congratulations on being accepted to your first choice of a college.  Unfortunately finances always come into play.  You can get student loans that you will start paying once you graduate.  I am not sure what the starting salary for a Criminology Major (depending on what you do professionally) makes, but you will also have rent, car, insurance, utilities, food, etc to pay for as well.  So you do not want to get into too much debt coming out of college.  With that said, perhaps you could look at other good Criminology Major schools to see if their costs are considerably lower, but still ranked high.     I would also hit any and all scholarship sites and apply for any and all to help pay for school.  You could look into  Cappex  and Niche. Other sites that I have heard students use is  ScholarshipZone ,  Scholarships  and  StudentScholarships . Another easy to use Scholarship site that has the amount, due date, etc. and easy to find is  Scholarships360 .     You will also need at least one stellar essay to copy &amp; paste or turn in when submitting for these scholarships.  I would suggest spending some time on a possible daily basis applying for any and all that you qualify for.  There are so many scholarships that do not get applied for.  Plus do not doubt your self worth - if you do not apply, you definitely will not get it.  &nbsp;  One last thing that I heard from my coworker is that his daughter is school, through her counselor, was able to get a list of scholarships she would qualify for. Some kind of program her high school counselor had access to so she could give her a print out or send electronically all the scholarships she would qualify for, but was up to her to reach out and actually apply for the scholarships. Good Luck! "
How do you start your own medical practice?," Do not to be afraid, try and try, brave enough, and believe that you can finish all the practices. You must begin, first and second.

Who creates flight schedules? How hard is a job like that?," As those before mentioned, the group is usually called Network planning or something similar. They make the decisions on when, where, how often and the types of aircraft. They look both at longer term 3-5 years as well as closer in to departure. These jobs are very heavily weighted to understanding data and using it to make decisions. Having a finance background is helpful, but also they employ people with an operations research background. A lot of people in Network Planning get their starts in revenue/inventory management to which there are usually a lot of entry level positions available.  "

Who creates flight schedules? How hard is a job like that?," Hey there!   Major airlines have a special department for this, it is called Network Scheduling and Planning. They analyze what routes to start/end, what planes to order/retire, and what time of departure is best to make the most profit.   It involves a lot of information gathering from areas such as economics, demographics, risk assessment, and even politics, among others. It is essentially one big puzzle!    I suggest you go for a business related degree for this job. That way you learn a lot about economics and how to carry out various statistical analyses.   I hope this helps! Good luck! "
what are the educational and personal requirements in becoming an actress?, Hi Emmanuella - There are many different ways that people get involved with acting careers. Many top collegiate acting programs will require an audition - you will need to prepare a monologue and sometimes a song. Taking classes and getting involved in your high school is drama programs is a great start! You may also want to check out any local or community theaters that may have roles for young adults. The best way to avoid fear and shyness is to conquer it head on - keep auditioning and performing!

How can I start my own record label?," Hi.  I hear many different things in your question - entrepreneurship, being a musician, starting a label, sound editing.  Wow!  Which one excites you the most?  Which one are you most talented in?  Being an ""entrepreneur"" is all the rage these days - as if anyone can do it.  I think it takes a certain kind of person - I believe it is a gift, even.  Hard work is essential, yes.  But there are so many other skills and character traits needed.  Do not go by what you see on ""Shark Tank!""  I am not discouraging you, I just think you need to know if you are wired that way.  I say it with respect because you have a rough road ahead of you, starting your own business.  Some people just have a knack, the personality to it - the drive and ambition that lets nothing stop them no matter what.  If that is you, you can make it.  As for starting a record label, READ READ READ!  Read up on what it takes, how it works, how you would do it, as there are a lot of business-y things and you do not want to waste money hiring a lawyer to set things up for you that you can do for yourself, if you are educated about it.  With the internet, your resources are unlimited.  Sound editing is a whole different ballgame.  You must be very technically inclined - have a mind for detail.  Usually the record label owner is not also the sound editor.  Again, you have a lot you seem to want to do.  But I still believe that focusing on one area at a time is best so you become really good, skilled, and educated at it - whatever it is.  Find a recording studio and see if you can intern there and ""shadow"" the sound editor.  See if that is what you really want.  There are also tons of small business owners that meet together - if you meet with them, you can learn the reality of owning your own business.  Do you know about meetup.com?  That might be a good place to start.  I wish you all the best!   "
How can I start my own record label?," How to start your own label.  First thing girst is completing school and learning how to manage a business.

if im late to a interview would i be taken off the list right away? what happens?," Hi Dalton,     Unfortunately, what we see time and time again in research, is that people is actions are much more predictive of their behavior than their words. So, when a candidate is late to an interview, that speaks more to me about their dependability than anything they say to me in the interview could make up for. With that in mind, do be very careful to avoid being late to your interviews. I recommend arriving early or finding a nearby coffee shop to kill some time in. This ensures you have plenty of time for last minute wardrobe fiascos or unexpected traffic.     Of course, interviewers and recruiters are human beings, too! If there is an extenuating circumstance that just could not be controlled for, it is best to be honest about that (ex. your car broke down on the way to the interview). But if it is something within your control (ex. you did not expect to hit so much traffic, so you arrive late) you should expect that this will impact the company is perception of you.     Good luck! "
if im late to a interview would i be taken off the list right away? what happens?," Hi Dalton,     It really depends on employers. However, even if you are not taken off the list for being late, it is not a good first impression and it will impact negatively when an employer is evaluating you.  "
Is it smart to pursue a career in medicine if you are not good at math?," The area of medicine is very broad with many opportunities to make a contribution even though you might not be good at math.

Would it be better to have a sociology major with a minor in human services or to have a double major both with them both?," Depending on what state you are from, you most likely need to become an LBSW (Licensed Baccalaureate  of Social Work). To do this, this means you need to major in Social Work to get your BSW (Bachelor in Social Work).      I am not 100% confident on this, but your sociology / human services major may not qualify you to become licensed as a social worker. Google what your state is requirements are to become a licensed social worker or ask your school is career advisor. Try to do this as soon as possible because I would hate for you to end up with a double major in something that does not apply to the social work you want to do!     https://www.humanservicesedu.org/social-work-license.html "

"Is it possible to get a degree in exercise science, and not specialize in something yet still get a good paying job?","Something to think about when you are considering jobs available through your education path is that our careers encompass many different things in addition to education. Other experience like volunteering, part-time work, and many other skill building activities all contribute to our overall employability.  To use a personal example, I took a very general degree because I was not sure what I wanted to do for work either. I ended up working at the Career Centre on campus as a student for a couple of years, and came back full time after I graduated.   If you are interested in exercise science and have the means to complete the program, I would recommend going for it without worrying too much about what comes after at this point. You can set some short-term goals and next steps to accomplish that can keep your skills up to date and keep you on the right path, and adapt your goals or plans for after you finish your education as you go.   If you are still unsure, try looking for someone with an exercise science degree and find out what they are doing. Your school may be able to help you find alumni like this. Ask them for an information interview, where you can sit down with them for 30 minutes and pick their brains about what their experience has been like during, and after school. "

What is the best advice that you have for an animation student?,"Teachers like to give the harshest treatment to the extremely talented.  It may because of jealousness or it may be to help prepare the student for the real world.  Either way, I have seen students quit because of it.  Do not fall into someone else is way of controlling you, even if it is a teacher.  If you come across this situation just do the work for them and move on.   Your degree is, I believe, and you can ask around, mostly a piece of paper that says, I am committed.  I am not a quitter.  I will meet deadlines.  I am prestigious and not an arrogant artist that thinks they do not need college.  If you come from a line of fine artists, you will be fine.   One of my most grandest luxuries during college is finding people to talk to.  It is what they call a support line.  My parents and a few students at school I met are my support line.  Just being able to talk about stuff and get it out, so you can focus on homework.  You can talk about good and bad things. Remember, young or old adults at college are there for the same reason you are.  This reason is to be successful.  Some people get their ideas from other people as they cannot think on there own.  They will use you, steal your ideas, and everything what not have you like that.  Even if you keep yourself isolated, it will happen, so make friends and be happy.  But be cautious. Have fun."
What is the best advice that you have for an animation student?," I highly recommend that you watch tutorials and practice in your down time. Sites like Skillshare, Linda.com, or even YouTube offer a vast amount of tutorials. These can help you get started in any programs you might need to learn for your classes and can give you a leg up on your classmates. If you have already got the creative side down, learning the technology will be your first step. See if you can find out what programs your favorite animators use and start using them! Most programs, such as Adobe Creative Cloud, offer student pricing for subscriptions. Try to get started with these programs as soon as possible so that by the time you graduate you are creating amazing work without stumbling through the technology!  "

Basically it never hurts to show a law school that you have varied interests and talents.

what kind of degrees do you have to have in order to be a c.p.s ( child pret. services)," Hi Jessica,   A 4-year degree in social work is required to work in government Child Protective Services agencies, and some states may require licensure as well. Licensure usually includes passing an exam and earning several thousand hours of supervised clinical experience. Some workers go on to earn their master is degree in social work.    Step 1: Earn a Bachelor is Degree in Social Work Most child protective services workers begin their careers by earning a bachelor is degree in social work. Such degree programs typically offer courses that teach prospective social workers how to interview clients, assess their needs and formulate potential solutions for the problems they face. Other skills learned may include crisis intervention, case management, community outreach, community organizing, research and advocacy. These degree programs generally combine theoretical knowledge with practical application.   Step 2: Gain Employment in a Child Protective Services Agency Some entry-level social workers are able to attain positions in child protective services immediately after college if they have completed an internship or other fieldwork program. Many child protective service agencies provide extensive on-the-job training to new social workers and a support base from co-workers in the field. New child protective services workers visit homes to assess potential problems and provide either counseling or intervention as necessary.    Step 3: Consider an Advanced Degree A Master of Social Work (MSW) is a requirement for child social workers looking to become child protective service supervisors or child services clinical practitioners or to enter social work mid-career. Master is programs can take 2-4 years to complete, either full or part time, and they do not require a specialized bachelor is degree in social work.

How do I find internships (eventually a career)  in a different city?,"I have used the method that Mireia suggests, but have also used the model of creating my own value proposition and take a week to go to a city where I wanted to be and start talking to people in coffee shops about the best places to work. Remember that no “permanent” job is a forever decision. You might find your first job in the new city is a food service job, but that’s ok. It gets you to the new town, where you can start networking for a cooler job."
How do I find internships (eventually a career)  in a different city?,"Hi Sarah!  I agree with the comments here and wanted to share alittle more.  I actually did what you are asking about, i.e., graduated college in one city and started my career in another.  I moved to Florida after college.  I had friends and family there, and I signed up at a temporary employment company.  These are also known as contractors, and example is NetEffects.  You sign up and they help you find work in your preferred field.  This could be a path to finding a great employer in a city you like.  It is how I found my full-time employer.  It is all about networking ""a.k.a. talking to people"" to ask questions and help you discover what is best for you.  Do not give up!  Enjoy your next city."
What careers should I explore if I want to work with animals?," 1) In high school you must display an interest in learning and the sciences in particular. Throughout your education, you should really work on your writing skills - communication is very important!!! Try to get a job or volunteer position working with animals, at a vet hospital, a local animal shelter, or animal rehabilitation facility.   2) Apply to colleges that are strong in biology and/or animal sciences. These two programs usually differ in focus - animal science usually focuses on applied aspects of animal production and care, while the biology track tends to focus on physiological, ecological and evolutionary science. Both tracks can allow a graduate to get a job in animal behavior right out of college. A third possibility is to apply to programs in veterinary technology.   3a) If you are interested in becoming a veterinarian, you apply for graduate programs during your senior year of college. There are very few vet schools, which makes the competition very tough. You must work very hard in college academically and display your drive and commitment by working or volunteering with animals in some way in order to have a good chance of getting in. Many students work at vet hospitals during college.   or   3b) If you are interested in research in animal behavior or physiology, you apply to graduate school during your senior year of college. Animal behavior graduate programs can be in either psychology or biology departments. There are masters programs that are typically 1-2 years or doctor of philosophy (phd) programs that are often 4-7 years long. To increase your chances of acceptance in these graduate programs, during college you should consider internship programs in an area of research that is interesting to you. There are many of these programs - check out animal behavior REU (research experience for undergraduates) programs. You can get a job with a masters degree in many different fields. If you go for a phd, you tend to really love research and school. Most people tend to stay working in universities. You can become a professor or a researcher. There is usually teaching involved even if research is your primary job. It is a long but very rewarding process! "
What careers should I explore if I want to work with animals?," Emily has really great advice above, but I thought I would add a couple thoughts:   Careers I considered when I thought about going into a profession with animals were: zoologist and animal behaviorist (someone who can train animals, studies their behavior, etc).   Something you could do, if you have the chance, is see if your local zoo or animal rescue/shelter has volunteer opportunities. Volunteering is a really great way to learn about different careers that involve animals.  "
Should I take summer programs or go to Community Colleges to earn some credits?," Hey Luis -- If I were in your shoes, I would take as many classes as possible from your local community college. It is a great place to take your basics. I understand you also want the campus experience. I do not blame you...it is a lot of fun. But, here is my advice -- take as many credit courses as you can at your local community college. It will be less expensive, you can develop solid study habits, and perhaps work part-time in the field you are interested in. Once you move to university, you can focus on your major and minor, join organizations, be part of the social/sports/music + arts groups -- whatever makes you happy. You are there to learn, grow, experience new things, new ideas and concepts -- it will be a great experience for you! College is so much different than high school -- so much BETTER!!!     Many students graduate from high school and go directly into their first college classes during the summer. That is an idea, but you might want to get a full-time job right after high school to save some money...OR work part-time and attend classes part-time. You will find the right balance for you. I wish you the very best!     ***Updated reply:     You are very welcome, Luis! Let me say that I am extremely proud of you for being the first in your family to take on this very exciting and achievable journey. You will do great! In my small family, I was the first to finish college. I had so many roadblocks and challenges thrown in my way. I did not graduate in four years -- it was more like 5-1/2, but who cares, right? I still did it!     More advice, if you are still living at home, and on your parent is insurance (and they are claiming you on their taxes), you might want to see if they are willing to apply for short-term loans. The FAFSA form is the start of the process: https://fafsa.ed.gov/. My mom was single when I was in college and we were able to get some cash to help pay for school. I would not suggest a large loan. You will also want to explore grants and scholarships (money that you do not have to pay back): https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships. They vary in type. Some are needs-based. Some are merit-based.     You might want to look at internships, as well. There is a lot of money and help out there. It is time consuming to navigate through it all, but so worth it to help offset the costs of college.     I am super excited for you. Please keep me posted about your journey.

Is it difficult to balance college and a job simultaneously?," Many people have done it successfully - including me.   I would like to share examples of how others have balanced and thrived during the college experience.  Perhaps, you can pick up some pointers that will help you along the way.   https://www.unigo.com/in-college/college-experience/creating-a-workschool-balance-a-college-student-perspective    http://www.mycollegesuccessstory.com/academic-success-tools/college-life-balance.html    http://www.collegeconfidential.com/dean/000241/      Here are some pointers on how to economize in college, so there will not be as much pressure on working:   http://www.educationplanner.org/students/paying-for-school/ways-to-pay/reduce-college-costs.shtml      It really does not matter where you go to school.

Is it difficult to balance college and a job simultaneously?," Hi Victoria,      It is not difficult, but you have to be disciplined. I worked three jobs in college, was on the track team at a DII college, an RA, and took 18 credits per semester and it actually worked in my favor.      You may find that, unlike many of your peers in college, you do not have the illusion of excessive amounts of free time where you can just drink and play games or take naps or scroll through Facebook. Instead, you will have to develop a schedule for yourself, blocking out time for pretty much everything during your day: eating breakfast, travelling to work, studying, etc. and then of course, time for you to have fun as well.      The good news is that, while you will not have as much free time as most others, you will be setting yourself up for life after college and will likely be able to keep yourself on track better than someone whose only responsibility is school.  If you do it right, your time management skills will be top-notch and they will easily transfer into post-graduate life, making you more valuable to employers.      If you can swing it, on-campus jobs are a really good option. I worked as a tutor, a Resident Assistant, and was an official and supervisor for the Intramurals program at my university. Some states/universities limit you to 30 hours a week for an on-campus job, but usually that is enough to help get you by during the semester.      Please let me know if you have any more questions!     Kind regards,   Nicole "
Is it advisable to intern as a first-year college student?," Hi Shrushti,   Great question! I would say definitely apply to an internship position as a first-year college student.    Not only could you find a great way to spend your summer break getting real industry experience, but it also prepares you for the process of getting an internship for the following years. Through the process of applying, you will get real practice in updating your resume, cover letter, and experience in interviewing!   I remember my first year of college, I had the same question, and I decided to give it a shot and apply to as many internships as possible. I actually was able to get an internship after applying to A LOT of companies, and I definitely still credit that first internship for allowing me to get internships down the road.    I hope you decide to try to apply, and good luck in your search!    Best, Kelly LaBuff "
Is it advisable to intern as a first-year college student?," Any experience you can get in your field is valuable. When applying for internships, be sure to highlight your strengths, experience and course work that might be of benefit the company and land you the job. Good luck! "
What are the best colleges to attend if you are interested in the perfrorming arts?," There are lots of great schools to look at, particularly in the Northeast.   Emerson College Boston University Boston Conservatory NYU Tisch Julliard Yale Brown The list goes on and one -- it depends what you are looking for in the overall program, size of school, type of school -- city or campus, etc.  You may also want to check where your favorite teachers and performers went to school.

How long does it take to become a lawyer?," To become a lawyer, you will probably need to go to college (usually 4 years) and then law school (3 years).  A lot of law school students come in with some work experience, which is usually pretty helpful as well!  If you think you want to be a lawyer, try to get internships that give you access to people who are lawyers.  Observe them closely and ask them questions.  Since you are in the 11th grade, you have plenty of time to do this.  Since law school is pretty expensive and time-consuming, it is important to be as sure of your decision as you can before committing!  Best of luck! "
whats some advice you would give a future college freshman," Hi Michelle...&nbsp; my advice for a future college freshman is:     *** If given the opportunity, go visit and explore potential colleges that you are interested in. I think it is important to visit&nbsp;schools so you can visualize being at the school for 4 years.      ***&nbsp; Take a lot of time to review college websites and weigh the pros and cons of attending a particular school.&nbsp; Do lots of research to understand all aspects of the school you&nbsp; would like to attend.     *** Know your budget.&nbsp; Some out of state and private colleges can be&nbsp;expensive. But, your in-state schools like UofA, ASU, and Northern Arizona&nbsp;University are pretty&nbsp; affordable.     ***&nbsp; Finish strong in high school.&nbsp; Your grades (and SAT scores) matter until you graduate from high school.&nbsp;      ***&nbsp; Have a back-up plan if you do not get into your ""first-choice"" school.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have a backup school just in case your dream school does not admit you... or the financial package from your dream school&nbsp;to pay for college is too expensive.     ***&nbsp; Apply to a few colleges that you are truly interested in. Different schools might offer better scholarships or more money for tuition.&nbsp; Have a few options to choose from.     Lastly,&nbsp;I live in Northern California.&nbsp; But, my two daughters both graduated from Arizona State University. They loved Tempe and being a Sun Devil.&nbsp; And, they both live in Tempe today... my daughters liked Arizona so much that they did not return to California after graduating from ASU.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smart kids....

What does it take to be a pro gamer?," All it takes is skill. Polish your reaction time and hearing. The E-sports are getting really hot and I can see this as a full time and well paid job.  I have a good connections on some pro level tournaments and teams that currently are building teams for Fortnite and PUBG. Furthermore, Full Sail University (located in Florida) is building the biggest S-sports arena (https://www.fullsail.edu/press-releases/2018/full-sail-university-unveils-plans-to-build-largest-on-campus-collegiate-esports-arena-in-the-us).     Final notes: If you are really interested on pursuing this path I would suggest starting your gaming channel and playing pro tournaments. "
What are good study habits to follow once you are enrolled in college? #college,"I would suggest you try to find what works for you.  Everyone will have different study habits that work for them.  Try reviewing some of the tips in this Google search results: https://www.google.ca/search?q=good+study+habits+for+(college+or+university)&amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enCA751CA751&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=qdr:y&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsgpKKmvHYAhVFd6wKHe4qB_0QpwUIHw&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=602&amp;dpr=1.13  Do you find it better to study in quiet or with some background noise? Do you like to study in a group or alone?  Does background noise really bug you?  Always a good idea though to keep good detailed notes from your classes that you can review.  Also have a group of classmates to collaborate or bounce ideas off, that is always great as well.  Try to get yourself organized as much as possible and commit to a plan of action to meet your schedule and needs.  Good luck!"
What are good study habits to follow once you are enrolled in college? #college,"Helllo De'Andre,  I would say time management is number one. You will have a greater workload compared to high school and also many social opportunities.   Take good notes in class, and avoid procrastinating when it comes to studying for tests and writing papers. Try your best to take advantage of the library during the week - it is a great place to focus and get your school work done!   "
What types of people should I begin to network with in order to spearhead my goal of teaching abroad and starting a non-profit mentoring program?," There are many different paths that you can take that will get you to the same goal of teaching abroad and starting your own non-profit. However, I do think there are a few things you can consider as you start to think about networking: (1) Think about getting exposure to different parts of the industry that you are interested in. Look up US-based organizations that send teachers abroad and look up teaching organizations in other countries that help place teachers locally. Find the people who run those organizations and find a way to connect. (2) Think about people who have work experiences that interest you and ask them to share their career path with you. Learning what they have done will help you develop a better gauge as to whether or not you want to create a path that is similar or different than theirs. (3) Look locally! One of the best things about going to college is that you already have a network of students, professors, and staff members all around the college/university who can point you in the right direction. Keep asking questions and look for chances to connect with people through events on-campus or programs that the school offers. "
What state requirements do I need to be able to become an ICU nurse?," States typically do not have requirements for specialty areas of nurses, but ICUs will have requirements for the staff they hire. First and foremost, you need to graduate from nursing school and pass your NCLEX. Second, ICUs look for nurses that are ACLS and BLS certified (Advanced Cardiac Life Support and Basic Life Support). Many nursing schools will offer or even require both for graduation.      You absolutely can be a new graduate and practice in ICU if the hospital has a New Graduate Nurse program. This usually involves extensive interviews and at least 4 months of on the job training with experienced nurses. These positions usually go to nurses that completed at least their final practicum/clinical/capstone in the ICU setting.      If you already have a job, telemetry and ICU step-down units are great places to begin for a transition into ICU.  "
What state requirements do I need to be able to become an ICU nurse?," As far as I know, there are not any state requirements in any state for being an ICU nurse.  Each facility establishes their own criteria for allowing a nurse to work in the ICU or CCU.  In general you could increase your chances of by having ACLS certification and experience in Telemetry. At a minimum, you should have experience, not be a recent graduate.  The other factor influencing ICU requirements is the location of the hospital. Example: a hospital in a city generally has a larger pool of nurse candidates to choose from and thus my have tougher criteria.  A facility in a rural or remote area with a smaller nurse population may be more flixable in their criteria and willing to take on an RN with less experience or fewer credentials.  Good luck.  "
What state requirements do I need to be able to become an ICU nurse?," Hi Kiara!   I am glad to see that you are interested in being an ICU nurse-   It is a great field.  You, of course, will need to be an RN first- so get your degree and pass your NCLEX for becoming an RN.   Interview for openings as an ICU nurse.  At our hospital, we do not always require experience or special education-- but we provide that to you when you are hired.   I work in the NICU, but I know that the adult ICU does a similar process-   We hire experienced staff preferably, but without experience I will take an applicant and train them.   We teach all of our new hires in a special course , all of the specific things we want a person to know and practice for their patient.   Best of luck to you in your future! "
What should I do afterschool in high school if I want to be a computer engineer after college?," You do not have to join a bunch of clubs, I would say learn a few key skills that are related to Comp E. Learn a programming language, Java is a great place to start, use codeacademy and youtube as resources. Make your own app for android or IOS, that is practical experience that is fun. Next would be to get involved in building your own electronics I would recommend looking into arduino projects and find what you like and build it from scratch. Its going to be different and fun but that would put you very far ahead of the game once you enter college. Even learning a bit of just circuit design would assist your development. Remember to have fun and do what you like, there is no point in spending your life doing something you do not love.  "
What should I do afterschool in high school if I want to be a computer engineer after college?," High School is a great time to begin your career path.  For individuals interested in video gaming you must first choose what discipline you enjoy - Production, Engineering, Game Design, Quality Assurance, Marketing all play roles in creating great video games.     For students interested in Game Design or Engineering there are a number of great resources on the web.  Code.Org has resources to teach students how to program, Gamasutra.com has lots of great information about the games industry.  The IGDA also has local chapters for gaming professionals and attending those events (even if you have to sneak in) can introduce you to technology and resources in your local area.  Computer clubs at your school or local community college can also provide valuable resources.    Getting time actually designing and building games is extremely important. There are a number of great prototyping languages available that can help budding game designers and engineers get their start.  Game Salad provides a simple environment for getting familiar with graphics and game constructs without having to learn to use a more complicated language and development environment.     For fully immersive introduction to gaming you can pick up a book like ""Introduction to Game Programming"" which is used as the text book in some college courses.  Programming languages like C++ are a must for professional level jobs and development environments like Unity also provide excellent resources online.  There are other languages like Objective C, and Java but C++ will provide a stronger generalized base for getting into the industry.   Good grades in Math and English are important since most engineering roles rely on solid math skills, and communication and documentation is important in any role. "
What should I do afterschool in high school if I want to be a computer engineer after college?," Joining clubs is great and lets you talk to like-minded individuals but as with any club the usefulness of the club is directly related to the people in it. Sometimes it just happens that there are not that many people in computer clubs (who would have thought hehe).   If you really like computers and figuring out how they work both at a basic level of the circuits and at a higher level of the software running on them then your best bet is to start doing some projects on your own time. Granted, it can be hard to motivate yourself to finish a project all the way through, that is usually where clubs come in since it is a lot easier to do a project with some friends then it is to do it all by yourself.   I, personally, always loved computers as well so any free time I had would go towards tinkering with electronics or figuring out how to program. Remember it does not have to just be about reading a textbook... most of the stuff you learn will be from projects that you get stuck on and need to find a solution to online or by talking to others. "
What should I do afterschool in high school if I want to be a computer engineer after college?," Hi, Alanna!  I think you should do both the club and also projects at home on weekends because they will both be really helpful to you.  Here are some bits from my experience; I hope it helps!       I hear you that computer club might be not much fun right now.  When my brother started high school, he was really into environmental issues, so he joined the school is ecology club and it was boring.  So he started making the club interesting by starting projects, asking teachers for help, and encouraging people to organize field trips.  Four years later, when I started high school, the Ecology Club was really big and active and was really popular.  So maybe you can help make the club more interesting.       When I first new I wanted to become an engineer, I thought it was interesting, but I did not know what engineers actually DO all day.  So I asked my mom for help to go meet some engineers at their offices and interview them, as if I were doing a report for school.  I loved it!  I discovered that the type of engineer I wanted to be was actually a boring job, and in the end I found out about types of engineering jobs I never knew existed.  It was very helpful.       I am super proud of you for starting now.  Many of the most successful people in the world started learning their expertise in their early teens, so it is really smart that you are starting now.       I wish you all the best. "
What should I do afterschool in high school if I want to be a computer engineer after college?," I think the most important thing you can do is participate in clubs that allow you to demonstrate how awesome you are. Find clubs that are active, participate in competitions, and have great mentors or advisors. The best way to differentiate yourself on an application for college, graduate school, or at a career fair is with meaningful activities that (a) taught you something valuable, and (b) gave you an opportunity to compete with peers at your level. Whether or not you actually win awards at the competitions is secondary but if you start early you will have a better chance!    As for what clubs or activities to join... I would recommend anything logic based such as the chess club or math club. Anything that gives you practice solving problems is also a great choice. Believe it or not, debate club, public speaking, or other ""non-traditional"" computer science activities will also help round out your experience and help you differentiate yourself.    My personal experience was very non-traditional. I worked for Microsoft in Redmond Washington right after graduating college. However, I studied chemical engineering and worked on renewable fuels in different research labs...non of this was related to computers or programming! I was also very involved in student government. I think the reason the hired me was because by the time I graduated I had participated in a number of events and won a couple of awards and had developed leadership skills that MSFT was interested in.  I guess the bottom line is to go find activities that you like and that give you a chance to develop skills and have meaningful experiences in order to prepare you for the future.  "
What should I do afterschool in high school if I want to be a computer engineer after college?," It takes a lot more than computer skills to be an effective computer engineer.  You should use your after school time in high school in clubs that help you hone your social and interpersonal skills.  When you go to work as a computer engineer (or any other profession for that matter!), you will see that the people who are most successful at work are not necessarily the most knowledgeable about the subject related to the job; the successful ones possess superior social skills and forge strong human bonds with their colleagues.  These skills are relevant to any job; I would encourage you to spend time becoming aware of them and getting better at them.  You will have enough opportunity to learn computer skills at college after you enroll.  Besides, the rate at which languages evolve, who is to tell that a language you learn today will still be relevant a few years hence when you graduate from college and are looking for a job? "
What should I do afterschool in high school if I want to be a computer engineer after college?," Hi Alanna   I am really glad that you are thinking through and planning how to utilize your spare time. That for you is a winners character. Many people who answered above gave some awesome suggestions, and I totally agree with them. If I had to add my few cents, your age is all about growing the confidence you would need to with stand the world you will be let into. At your age you can try n many things and can still afford to fail. That gives you the liberty to try things. You can try all different things suggested in the above answers, (as someone above suggested) if you are not liking something try fixing it. Whatever you attempt to do be a keen observer and read through things. I am sure in the process you will find your niche. As you grow you will get to know how to build upon that.   Whatever you do keep enjoying it ! Keep Smiling : ) All the Best ! "
What should I do afterschool in high school if I want to be a computer engineer after college?, You can learn by going to online free tutorials and youtube videos of the language you want to learn. 
How can you focus on college work when you have 3 other people in your dorm room?," The library has pretty extended hours.  Or, you might think about making some house rules from the get-go, with specified quiet times, requiring music to be low or headphones to be worn, having guests over, etc. Even though they are good friends, too much togetherness is hard to handle. While you should not have to leave your own home to study, you might find that the dorm starts to feeling closed in after a while. If not the library, look for other secluded spots, form study groups with classmates, etc.       Also, roomies are not always a bad thing. While I did not live on campus, we did carpool. The ride time gave us time to proofread each others' papers (yes, before the electronic age), toss around ideas, review test prep questions, and drill on vocabulary cards. You can help each other study.      UT is a beautiful campus - enjoy it! What is your major? "

How do I know what type of engineering to choose," Engineering is a wonderful career choice! Although I changed my career path to become a lawyer, I studied bioengineering in college and graduate school.   It sounds like you might want to do some more research into civil engineering or mechanical engineering. Civil engineers are involved in the design of structures, so this would go well with your love of buildings. Mechanical engineers can be involved in many different things, but your love of ""tinkering"" seems to mesh well with mechanical engineering. They are often involved in the design of mechanical things (think cars and other machines). Mechanical/aeronautical engineers are specifically involved in the design of planes and other flying things (think space ships!).    Other types of engineering are electrical, software, biological, chemical and environmental. If you can imagine something in this world, an engineer was probably involved in its development!    Good luck, and please ask more questions if you have them. "
How do I know what type of engineering to choose,"Do what you are interested in！  Are you more interested in civil engineering or mechanical engineering? Civil engineers involved in the structural design, mechanical engineers can participate in many different things, but you seem to ""tinkering"" hobby and mechanical engineering are in good agreement. They are often involved in the design of machinery.   So, it is most important to do what you are interested in! Good luck！ "

What careers are options for me if I am interested in an Interdisciplinary Ph. D. in English Literature and Psychology?," Frankly, I have NEVER heard of any graduate level programs in both psychology and English Literature.   The typical humanities doctoral program candidates take over 10 years to degree completion. Job prospects for the humanities is abysmal in today is job market. You can check with the Chronicle of Higher Education (Chronicle.com).   It takes on average 5-6 years for the completion of a doctoral level program in psychology. Admission to these programs is highly competitive.   Clinical psychology programs are THE most competitive. Clinical psychology is not the most lucrative, from an annual salary perspective. I-O psychologists and consulting psychologists are generally among those with the highest salary. Another resource for you is www.apa.org   I wish you the best in the decision making process with your future educational pursuits. "

What obstacles or mountains must an actor/actress overcome to be assigned major film roles?,"Okay, Peace, learn as much as possible in college. Learn all the skills that interest you as you have listed. Take a look at a local theater, and audition or volunteer in the office. You might work with someone who will offer a hand later. But there is very little salary unless you are working at a regional theater or Broadway. Regarding your desire to work in the film industry might take years. You could sign with an agent, and start working as an extra. However, management and tech would be a far easier way for employment. Nobody starts working over night, and everybody has their own personal way. And you really should pay attention to the film industry being discussed in Twitter or Facebook or especially Studio 32.  Then you will read the best daily tips. And such a career takes persistence. Good luck. "
What obstacles or mountains must an actor/actress overcome to be assigned major film roles?,"Hello Peace I.  I am not sure I have ideas to offer that offer much that has not been said by the other great contributions I see on my screen above, but I will try to convey my take as well.    I agree that educationally, you should seriously study at least one other subject in addition to Drama/Theatre/Acting.  Majoring in something besides acting (#science and #tech seem like the best bets these days) allows you to support yourself while you are running around going to auditions, and they might also provide great background information if you decide to write your own material.  One young woman I recently auditioned  for a lead role drove up in a brand new Mercedes and the thing that paid for it was her (other) career as a reporter on TV here in Los Angeles.  She finished second in the competition for our role but she drove home in a car much newer and better than mine.   Another key thing I would suggest is that you have to be #relentless and have a thick skin, never getting discouraged (long-term) after a rejection, which we all get  20 (or more) times as often as an acceptance.   Finally, I would say that stretching yourself, creatively, is a key.  Try things occasionally that are out of your comfort zone, roles that are challenging, playing characters with whom you might initially have a difficult time connecting.  Creative risks breed confidence and are impressive.  But make sure you do all the research you can as part of the process.  Best of luck moving forward!"
What obstacles or mountains must an actor/actress overcome to be assigned major film roles?," Hi there! Whew, this is a tough question to answer in a short amount of time. But I will do my best.    1 - Learn as much as you can in college! Whether it is about theatre or film, you can not know too much.  This will come in handy with a couple of other points.   2 - Put yourself out there. The biggest mountain an actor/actress will ever overcome is themselves. You will be staring at a role that fits you perfectly, then doubts will start to set in. I am not tall enough, I am not pretty enough, I am not good enough. But do not let you get in your own way. You never know if that one audition will be your big break!   3 - Be persistent. A lot of people quit when the going gets tough. Keep going!   4 - When the time comes, be ready! Remember all that stuff you learned in school?  Your head will be in the game and your nerves will not get the best of you if you are prepared for every audition.   5 - Create your own material. So many well known actors, writers, directors did not wait for an opportunity to present itself, they made their own. Remember all that stuff you learned in school? That is everything you need to create your own projects.   4 - Go for it! This is a tough career, but you will never if it is supposed to happen for you if you do not that  first step. Take it. Then the next one. Then the next one. Go for it! "

"When applying to selective colleges, can AP tests be substituted for ""recommended"" SAT subject tests?"," Ava,       Another great question, you are on a roll. So I took AP classes and SAT subject tests as the college that I ended up going to heavily recommended both. From my understanding, I could be wrong, you can *not* substitute AP tests for SAT subject tests given that they are different exams and are scored differently.  I am under the belief that colleges want to see that you went above and beyond by signing up for a subject test and scoring well on them.      I am not sure what year you are, but if you still have time I would try and take an SAT subject test for a subject that you are currently taking an AP exam for. For example, during my Junior year of high school I took AP U.S. History and signed up for the U.S. History SAT subject test. The SAT subject test was one week after my AP exam and it was really easy given that I had take the AP class and had prepared for the AP exam. I ended up doing really well and did not have to study additionally for the SAT test. If you find yourself doing worse on SAT subject tests, try and remember that wrong answers penalize you and lower your overall score. If you do not know an answer, randomly guessing can really hurt your overall score. Not answering a question gives you 0 points, but picking the wrong answer is -2 (or -1, I forget).      Also, I would ask your college/academic counselor as well as call the admissions department of the universities that you are applying for. Things may have changed since I applied to college and it never hurts to double check!!     I hope this helps and I wish you the best of luck!!     Best,  Austin  "
What is the difference between a B.A.S. and a B.S.?," The difference is in the coursework that you do. It will vary by the universities, so just take a look at the coursework required for the degree and see if its courses you would like to take. While I do not know this to be true or not (I have a BS), I am told that BAS generally do not prepare you for grad school as well as a BS does. Please note, this answer is specific to America and your mileage may vary in other countries.   As far as what degree you should get, I recommend that you not focus solely on marine biology. Even though I do have a BS in Marine Biology, in some ways, it did stunt the courses that I took. When I met with my advisor and stated that my goals were to get into grad school, he charted a course that looked a lot more like an ecology major. For you, I would recommend that you either get a degree in the sciences, e.g. biology/chemistry/physics. It will give you a lot more options should you decide halfway through it that you do not want to continue on into marine biology, which is a very niche field.   For the most part, what most people think of as marine biology requires a grad degree, either a masters or PhD. It tends to be grunt work, and not so much research, at the bachelor is level. Any of the above science majors will prepare you well for marine biology. Keep in mind, though, that marine biology is a very broad field, so you would also be well served to volunteer in some labs to narrow down your interests. "
What is the difference between a B.A.S. and a B.S.?, Science is so awe inspiring - get the credits and immerse yourself in every subject- you will absolutely love it! 
What is the difference between a B.A.S. and a B.S.?, Biological science degree and former Veterinary tech experience as well as science educator experience  
how can we improve the engineering quality in india?," It is wonderful that you love your country. India is a special place. The best way to improve it is to improve yourself. Be the best you can be and give back to the economy of India. Many Indians decide to work outside of India. This is great for the individual and the country where they move. However, this means that all of those great minds and talents are benefiting other countries. You could make a difference right where you live by using your talents and education to build your local economy and infrastructure.  "
What is the environment like in a culinary school/workspace?," Lots of practice prepping, sampling, cooking, etc. "
How many hours is too many to work during college?," Hi Ava,         Really great question as many people probably are wondering the exact same thing.  I worked a retail job during my sophomore year of college and interned during my junior year so I have some idea what a realistic time commitment is. For me personally I found it difficult to work more than 25 hours a week whether it be my part time job or internship. I was taking five classes a semester and had class everyday of the week. Going to class, going to work, and having time to study was manageable but by no means was it fun nor an easy thing to do.  The amount of hours that you will be able to work without giving yourself a stress-induced heart attack really depends on the amount of classes you are taking per semester, hours of classes per week, and on what days your classes are on. If you load up classes on three days of the week, then you will be able to work two days out of the week plus weekends.  If your classes are easy and do not require much studying or homework then you are in an even better position to allocate more time to work. To determine what the maximum number of hours you can work, first look at your class syllabus and understand what is expected of you and what the time commitment is. If you find your class to be easy/hard , adjust your work hours accordingly.      If you are taking hard classes, working 30 hours a week will be very difficult and likely would not be a wise choice. If you are stressed due to overloading yourself, not only will your grades suffer but your performance at work will suffer as well. Find out what works best for you given your class/study time and adjust your work hours accordingly; everyone is different so it is hard to say that there is one magic number that all people should follow if they are working during college.      I hope this helps and I wish you the best of luck.  "
What steps do I take to become a police officer?," I am a retired senior non-commission officer US Army and Federal Law enforcement Officer and well as a former law enforcement officer in the State of Georgia. Not all states, city and county law enforcements agencies have the same requirements. 1st, you must at least have a high school diploma but some agencies require an associate or Bachelors degree. For Federal law enforcement all require a Bachelors degree and their retirement benefits are better then State, County or City governments. However, with the Federal government you are required to move around often while in State law enforcement agencies you are basically more stable. You have to make up your mind in what law-enforcement agency you want to apply for and find out what are their requirements as far as schooling is concerned. I recommend that you get a collage degree because you will be more marketable in law-enforcement. You have to really be physically fit because in the Police Academy you do get physical training. If you are not physically fit, you will not be able to do your job out in the streets where you will be patrolling. The written tests in the police academy are not easy and you have to be a good writer. As a police officer, your reports must be very clear because in some cases you will have to go to court and testify. When writing police reports if you use, Who, What, When, Where and Why, this will help you quite a bit because you already have the questions needed and all you have to do is answer them accordingly. For example Who, could be the complainant or perpetrator and others involved. What, will be basically be the type of complaint called in or reported via the police dept. or your patrol car. When, would be the time the crime/incident occurred. Where, would be the location in which the crime/incident occurred. Why, is the reason or explanation of what happen. Why did you run from the scene?? Why did you hit him with? Why did you have to fire on him/her. The way you articulate your report will make it easier for you when testifying in court. I recommend a study guide that most police academies have?? Hope this will help in following your dreams in a career in law enforcement!! "
I am looking for information about Career Village scholarships. Please direct me to the relevant web page.," Hi Shennaz - it is great that you are looking for way to pay for college.  Unfortunately, the promo that careervillages was offering to get more students active on their site has ended.  The link https://go.careervillage.org/scholarships/  has the info.  And since I do not see that you have posted additional questions to the site, it seems you did not find it.  I myself just joined yesterday.  I think it is a cool idea, so be sure to tell your friends if they have questions about careers or college to come and post questions.     And maybe careervillage will have another scholarship opportunity in the future.  Best of luck!  Lisa "
How can I specialize as a veterinarian?," Congratulations on being interested in becoming a vet. It takes a special person to enter this field and meet the demands which this career area presents.&nbsp;The first step is to get to know yourself to see if you share the personality traits which make vets successful.&nbsp;The next step is doing networking to meet and talk to and possibly shadow vets to see if this is something that you really want to do, as a career area could look much different on the inside than it looks from the outside.&nbsp;&nbsp; "

What is needed to become an Acoustic Engineer?, Electrical/electronic engineer would be great. You need a good DSP understanding. Some good schools may offer a degree in music engineering. Check out Penn States acoustic program as a reference.  
What advice would you give to current undergraduate students?," College is such an amazing time. You are often on your own for the first time, you are enjoying new freedoms, making new friends, joining social clubs, and so on.   First thing is learn time management. You will have so much on your plate depending on your involvement, class load, work schedule, life in general. You will find at times you can be pulled a million ways and it quickly can become overwhelming. The quicker you develop time management skills the easier it will be, and those skill definitely will help you later on in the work force.  Schedule out and organize your days, create to do lists so you can see your accomplishments.  Be balanced, schedule fun time and time with friends, but also set aside study times, and relax moments.  Having a grasp on your time, will increase your preperation and decrease your stress.      Remember #Umatter, best of luck. "
What advice would you give to current undergraduate students?," Take advantage of every opportunity that is given to you. Pay attention in class. Do not procrastinate. Use your resources such as your professors, other students in your class, and always ask questions when you do not have any understanding. When I was in college, I took 15 hours so i could graduate with my class. The next semester, I overloaded myself and took 18 hours thinking it would be super easy. It was the hardest semester of my college life. Do not overload yourself. Take the classes you are supposed to take but try 15 initially. You will not have a life if you try to add too much to your plate.  "
What advice would you give to current undergraduate students?," Go to class and review your notes later on in the day, never procrastinate because it leads to disasters, and think ahead to reduce work loads. Moreover, do not forget your body; sleep enough, eat well, and do not forget to work out periodically. Lastly, having a social life is required to have a healthy life. "
What classes should I take in college to become a pediatrician?," This is a wonderful career choice!  While in high school, be sure to take biology, chemistry and other science classes.  This will build your foundation for the science courses that will be required for a biology / pre-med major.  Try to enjoy and take in as much knowledge as possible during lab classes.  Lab work helps students apply the class work to real science questions.  Many colleges have pre-med programs so you should be able to find a university that fits your needs.  But another thing that you can do now that can help prepare you and that you can include on your college application and resume, is to volunteer, perhaps at a day care, youth program, or even a children is church program.  Being a pediatrician requires the interests and love for children and working with children early shows that you have that interests, patience and support! "
Will BSN graduates need to obtain their master is degree in order to remain an RN in the future?,"I doubt there will come a time that the bedside nurse is required to have an MSN. However, I think the trend is moving toward requiring or highly desiring an MSN for any sort of nurse manager position. I do not officially graduate with my MSN for another month, and have yet to take my NCLEX, and I can already tell that there is an assumption that I desire to quickly move into management, or that I will be poached to do so. As with the trend of wanting bedside nurses to have BSNs this comes from hospitals trying to earn ""Magnet"" designations."
what is a normal work week for a construction job?," Luke,     The quick answer is: 40 - 50 hours per week which typically includes Saturdays.     Your question could also suggest that you are wondering if a construction job could mesh with your current responsibilities or lifestyle.     The good news is that there is a shortage of construction workers today so you could eventually approach the bargaining table with your personal wishlist of more pay and less work.     If you are young, physically able and generally have a curiosity about how things are put together, I am going to recommend that you immerse yourself in construction, pick up a framing hammer and: talk to journeyman workers, find local organizations e.g. carpenter is unions, youtube wood frame construction, google how to run a contracting business and research anything and everything that interests you about the construction industry.     The harsh reality is construction is difficult manual labor, but if you can learn to see the big picture, that you can run your own contracting business one day, or how an engineer designed an earthquake-proof house or how an architect designed a corner window could pivot your interests to engineering or architecture school.     Not only will you learn the important skill sets of building a house, but you will also learn to develop discipline, learn how to deal with others on the jobsite and hopefully learn to be a decent human being. So if you plan to pursue a career in construction, go all in with eyes and ears fully open.     In the end, whatever you decide to do, you will find that your success in a career is usually directly related to the amount of time you choose to spend on it. "
what is a normal work week for a construction job?," Hi Luke,     A normal work week for construction depends on the job at hand. It is usually 5 days a week minimum, but as the project gets busier surrounding certain pushes, overtime at night and on the weekends may be required.  Vacation time will vary depending on the company you are hired by. For the jobs my friends and families have worked, it has averaged around 10 days off per year. "
Can I get an internship as a sophomore?," Kimberly, I would recommend volunteering as a starting point, particularly since you are still exploring areas of interest. Non-profits and community organizations are a great place to plug in as they always need an extra set of hands. Volunteer to help in their marketing department/area.  This will get you a foot in the door somewhere, help you start exploring the work to see what you like and what you do not like, will give you relevant experience for your resume and if they like you, you will have a leg up on any internships that become available.  Your career center should be able to help you narrow your focus on organizations that fit your interest profile.  Good luck! "
Can I get an internship as a sophomore?," Yes,yes,yes! You can and should get an internship as a sophomore, the earlier the better in my experience. I had three internships throughout my time in college and they were by far the best experiences of my four years. Not only do they provide great material for your resume and for you to discuss during a job interview, but they provide you with opportunities to explore potential career interests and career paths.      Its great that you are thinking about internships so early on and that you recognize their value, that is a huge step; many students your age do not fully realize that four years is pretty quick and that internships are often a requirement for landing a job after graduation. Your college is student career office should have a job board and/or career guidance counselors whose job it is to help you apply for, find, and get internships and jobs. I would start there, and if that does not work, asking a professor or a friend for any leads never hurts.      A friendly piece of advice, do not stop interning after you get your first one; I had a few friends who thought that one high-profile internship was enough and they were sorely mistaken. Intern every summer that you can and if it works with your schedule and commitments, attempt to intern during the academic year. It may be a lot of work, but landing the job of your dreams is worth all the work!! "
Can I get an internship as a sophomore?," Hi Kimberly! It is great that you are being proactive about getting an internship early on during your college years.  My first two internships in college were during my sophomore year; and although they were not with big companies, I obtained valuable experience that helped me land internships with major companies later on in college.  Start with recruiting fairs, the career centers, and Linkedin search.   Most importantly, make sure you apply.  Even if you feel like you have no shot at getting the internship, there is no harm in trying.  You can obtain valuable interview experience, and maybe even land the gig! "
I am currently a college freshman interested in robotics and also interested in ocean   exploration .  How can I combine these interests for a career?," Hello Jarod, I am currently a robotics software engineering intern at NASA working with the CanadaArms on the ISS. My advice to you would be first getting a B.S. engineering degree.  I would recommend Electrical, Computer, Mechanical engineering. Now to give you some very important information. Be involved in as many robotics programs you can. Whether that be competitions or robotic clubs at your school. These events/groups helps you network and meet others interested in what you want to do. Networking is extremely important. Here are some important subjects. Linear Algebra is extremely important. C++, Python,  general best practices for code, design structures, object orientated programming, learning ROS, learning Linux environments. Learn as much as you can. Do not be afraid of any of it. Learning takes time, always maintain a growth mindset. ""I may not know it now, but one day I will"". Believe. "
Which is better for an IT job? Trade school or college?," I can only speak for myself so personally it all depends on how dedicated you are. For me, I went to college for media production which encompassed many areas of media, including web design/development. However, on my own, I did my own training, research and countless hours of practice/tests. All of this lead me to freelancing for 10 years prior to the job I am currently at. My personal opinion, you can not learn everything in a 6 week or 4 year college degree program. You need to put in your own time into it so you can make it yours and let that shine out which will help you get hired and desired. "
Which is better for an IT job? Trade school or college?," I suggest college if you have the stamina to go through 4 years and you are willing to pay the price. The reason is that with a college degree you have much more flexibility (you want to be able to pick a career that interests you) and the ceiling is higher. Meaning you will come to a point in your career where you want to aim for a higher paying job, maybe become a manager, and a college degree often becomes a requirement to be accepted for this. If you are not able to advance in your career, your pay or you will see other employees get picked for jobs instead of you, then that is no fun, believe me. "
Which is better for an IT job? Trade school or college?," From my past experience, it is very important to have a college degree in this competitive world.  Since you are aiming for IT jobs, I would suggest you to plan for a Degree in Computer Information Systems OR similar specialization.   Hope , it helps. - Thanks  "
Which is better for an IT job? Trade school or college?," I agree with the above. If you can overcome the cost and other hurdles, then a 4 year program is going to benefit more in the long run. Not only will your ceiling be higher, but (whether this is right or wrong is a different debate) you will be more respected in the IT world with a 4 year degree rather than one from a trade school.*   *I will note that this is from my experience only and I do not have data to back it up.  "
Being a philosophy major is something of interest to me but I often hear that it is useless when working- how do I get the most out of a philosophy class and at was school to make it worth it?," I think Philosophy is a great major because it teaches you how to evaluate information from different perspectives as well as how to logically analyze an point of view. The skills that you learn from Philosophy can help you in any job after college.  If it is a subject you are interested in, trust your instincts and go for it!     Several people I know have majored in Philosophy but they also had another major (double major) that was more ""practical"" like economics, or politics or business. The double major allowed them to study what they wanted and land good jobs after college too. Many of them used the Philosophy major + other major to get into law school or business school afterwards.   College is a time to explore and try out different classes... Do not worry so much about the work... If you are doing something you love, the work will definitely come! "
Being a philosophy major is something of interest to me but I often hear that it is useless when working- how do I get the most out of a philosophy class and at was school to make it worth it?,"Many things that seem worthless are important.

Being a philosophy major is something of interest to me but I often hear that it is useless when working- how do I get the most out of a philosophy class and at was school to make it worth it?," Hi Aukai,   Philosophy graduates are found working for almost every type of employer in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors. They work in organisations such as the National Health Service (NHS), the Civil Service and for advertising, marketing and public relations agencies. The investment banking industry and legal sector prove popular choices, as do publishing firms, charities and recruitment agencies.   Skills for your CV Studying philosophy helps you:     analyse and construct sound arguments;   distinguish fine differences between views and find common ground;   present ideas convincingly through well-constructed, systematic arguments;   write clearly and persuasively;   generate ideas and come up with solutions to problems;   be open to new ideas and ways of thinking.     For careers such as law, lecturing and teaching, further qualifications are essential. For careers such as journalism and advertising, a postgraduate qualification may be useful, but it is relevant work experience that is essential. To decide if further study is necessary you should research the career areas that interest you.   Many philosophy graduates continue with further study of their discipline, possibly with the intention of pursuing a career as a lecturer, but often due to their love of philosophy. Other graduates chose to study something vocational at postgraduate level - common areas have included law, publishing and journalism.   Here is some job examples:       Editorial Assistant Median Pay: $36,000 The first avenue to look towards for a job-seeking philosophy major is one in which you can apply your skills at speaking and writing. Some of these opportunities might involve starting up the latter of the publishing industry as a publishing or editorial assistant for an established writer or firm. Editorial assistants are often flexible positions within a firm – they sometimes represent the company, write editorials, acts as assistants, read and edit manuscripts, and organize schedules.       Paralegal Median Pay: $38,000 A paralegal performs legal work under the supervision of lawyers such as research and writing legal documents. These tasks are well-suited for philosophy majors, who are well-trained in writing and creating good arguments. A paralegal is also well-prepared to go on to law school and become a lawyer if interested.       Public Policy Median Pay: $57,000 Public policy involves analyzing and solving problems that affect many people, often at the government level. Working in public policy involves policy research, communicating ideas with others, and creating arguments, as well as unraveling the arguments of others. All of these skills use the philosophy major’s ability to create and differentiate between good and bad arguments, along with research and writing skills.       Non-Profit Median Pay: $47,000 The non-profit sector involves working for a cause, which can be anything, including education, hunger, the arts, or the environment. Working for a non-profit can involve outreach, communications, program development, or volunteer coordination. Philosophy majors interested in ethics and social or political philosophy get to put their writing and speaking skills to good use at a non-profit.       Other Possible Career Paths for Philosophy Majors:   Blogging Journalism Public Relations, Advertising, and Marketing Copywriting, Technical Writing, Grant Writing   Things a Philosophy Major Should Learn and Do to Prepare:   If your strongest skills are those of writing and editing, it’s a good idea to start to create an online presence for yourself. A simple blog can, and increasingly is, a substitute for or facet of your online portfolio as a writer. When applying for jobs that require writing, employers are going to want to see some examples of what you can do, period. A foundation of writing samples and continued work on a blog site show dedication, applied writing, and your ability to create content for an audience other than yourself, if informally.

What General Education Class should I take over the summer?," I took  credits the summer after high school. I was entering a large school and had been told that some of the general education requirements like English and history were very large classes and notorious ""weed out"" courses. So I chose to take these classes in summer school at the local community college where the class size was smaller and I could complete the coursework quickly vs dragging it out over a semester.  "
Would it be hard to pursue a career that you did not major in in college? Can they do it?," Absolutely! I got degrees in Russian, International Business, and Finance. While I was in college, I spent a couple summers in Russia because I wanted to be a Russian Stockbroker. While I was there, I realized that staying in the US, among friends, would be a lot more fun. So I started learning how to program and ended up being a programmer by trade. I am completely self-taught, but I did audit some computer science classes my (2nd) senior year. I had to go to college for 5 years to complete my three degrees, but none of them had much to do with programming.   I did have to study a lot to learn how to program. I started out by getting certifications in Microsoft and Java technologies, then I applied for and found jobs where I was able to use those skills. Then I started contributing to open source projects and talking about them at conferences. I even wrote one of the first books on Spring way back in 2004. Contributing and writing about open source really put my career in high gear and I have not looked back since! "
Would it be hard to pursue a career that you did not major in in college? Can they do it?," The most successful people I have encountered in my life are in fields they did not major in! Steve Jobs once said of Apple, ""It is in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough—it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”   The same applies to individuals -- some of the best software engineers I have hired grew up on farms and did not major in Computer Science. Many of the best problem solvers I have known were multi-lingual or great musicians.   Think about college as giving you the basic skills you will need to get into a field -- beyond that, much of your success will come from all of the other things (life experiences, empathy, hobbies, interests, passions, etc.) that make you you! "
Would it be hard to pursue a career that you did not major in in college? Can they do it?," Hi Josephine!   You most certainly can start a new career after graduation! Many professionals start out in one career and while engaged discover that they have a passion for something else.  I started out my career as an executive level admin and branched out to marketing.  My passion was Information Technology so although I was not specifically working in a IT department I was endowed with learning new technology daily.  Automating reports and system processes was the driving force behind gaining experience while in a completely different career.  I began to network with professionals in the industry that I desire to transition to within my organization as well as outside of my working hours.  This helped me define my transition path.     Ultimately, you must be strategic when it comes to developing your career path.  It does not matter if you start out on that career path or another.  Once you make a decision began to network and focus on a transition path.  With a plan in place everything is attainable.   Best of luck! "
Would it be hard to pursue a career that you did not major in in college? Can they do it?," Hi  Josephine!   Yes it is possible.  I set up and ran a re-employment program for people who had lost their jobs.  Many times they had pursued a career area for some other reason than personal choice or they were locked into it for many reasons.  Losing that job in that career area gave them an opportunity to start anew.  The first thing that I did was to administer an interest and aptitude test to help them to discover themselves and see how they could put their life is experiences into a more fulfilling mode.  Many times, this was the first opportunity that they had to do so.  After learning more about themselves, I taught them networking.    Best of luck! Be true to yourself. The feeling and concept of success is yours - and is very personal. Let me know if this is of help. "
Would it be hard to pursue a career that you did not major in in college? Can they do it?," Absolutely.  I did this in fact.  I knew that I wanted to study business administration in college but I was not sure what I would do with the degree after graduating.  My undergrad degree led me to an interesting opportunity in Sports Marketing and I decided to continue directly into grad school to pursue my MBA with a focus on Sports Marketing.  This was an emerging and exciting field at the time and it was even more interesting to me as an athlete.  After getting my MBA I rolled right into an internship with Anaheim Sports having direct experience with the Anaheim Angels and Anaheim Mighty Ducks.  Both were owned by Disney at the time so I thought this would be a great opportunity and it was however I quickly learned that there are few high ranking positions and those that have them tend to have long careers.  I am originally from San Francisco and decided to go back home and expose myself to the tech industry that was booming at the time.  I took a front office group sales position with the San Francisco Giants given my experience in sports and desire to get back to the bay area which was a great experience as the Giants were moving into a new stadium that year.  After doing this for less than a year I landed an entry level sales position in technology.  With the desire to learn and work hard I had what turned out to be a great start in technology.  That company ultimately went out of business but that had little impact on me as I was in the industry and there was plenty of opportunity elsewhere.  I landed another entry level technology sales position and this turned into a 10 year run.  I gradually moved up in the company, gained a lot of experience, a great reputation and established a career.  I have been in technology sales for 18 years now and its proven to be satisfying.     So yes it is certainly possible to change your career path and find a job that is fulfilling.  It starts with a desire and willingness to work hard.  You may have to start with an entry level position but you should expect this as there is too much competition in business to think you can start any career at a high ranked position.  Work hard, be patient and good things will happen.   Best   Curtis "
Would it be hard to pursue a career that you did not major in in college? Can they do it?," Absolutely!!!

Towards, the end of that stint, i realized that i was very interested and curious about how we market and sell things. As an engineer i always though why are we doing this or why are we creating such a product and not something else. That curiosity made me sought out people in sales and marketing and i networked with almost everyone in my company and 6 months later, when there was a marketing position open, i applied for it. Even though i did not have an MBA back then, my persistence got me the an opportunity to try out that role to see if i was a fit. I loved the role and in a month secured a full time position! "
Would it be hard to pursue a career that you did not major in in college? Can they do it?," Hello!  Whilst I live in the UK I am sure it will be similar in the US.

For example, someone may have studied history but could end up working for a charity. It is all about the skills you develop which are transferable. It may be that whilst studying/working you consider getting some work experience or volunteering. Or it may be that you begin a postgraduate course. It is definitely doable!  "
Should uni student start a nigh shift full-time job or normal part time job?," Without knowing everything about your specific situation it is hard to advise you individually but if you are looking to just gain experience and can go without the additional money for the time being I might suggest volunteering your time at a specific company or job you would be interested in working for in the future. Most places would be more willing to accept your volunteer work and you would have more control over your particular experience area and location.    As far as working a night shift, there have been multiple studies over recent years identifying the negative health affects of working that kind of schedule. If you have to make that decision do so with that information in mind.   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/shift-work-health-risks_n_5672965.html "
How do you make applying for colleges less stressful?," Get with your counselor if you are in high school or visit a college.

How do you make applying for colleges less stressful?," The most important thing is to get to know yourself well enough to have a career focus. Then you can talk to people involved in your career area to determine what path to follow based upon their input and advice.     Also, it really does not matter where you to to school. What really matters is how well you do in school and how well you do in person face to face networking with people involve in your career area. Here is a video presented by a person who used to work for Stanford University relating the fact that it really does not matter where you go to school.

"Army guy looking for educational help, career wise."," Hi,   Thank you for serving!   In addition to all the excellent advice above, I would suggest that you start talking with people about what they do, what a typical day and year is like in that career, and what the most common career paths are within that career. You can also ask them things like what they like and dislike most about it. You can start with people you know and sometimes they will know other people you should talk with. (If you meet in a professional setting, these fall within the broader category of ""information interviews."")    Be sure to learn and to factor in things like how social you want each day to be, how you feel about being interrupted, and whether you like a plan to never change versus a plan that is more dynamic and being continuously updated based on new information. These may sound like small things, but they can have a profound impact on personal satisfaction and happiness.    Once you find a particularly interesting path, you might ask if you can shadow someone for a few hours or a day. They may or may not be able to let you, but if you find someone who can, you can gain enormous insight into how you feel about the job.   I hope you find your answers and wish you all the best! "
"Army guy looking for educational help, career wise."," David, it sounds to me that you have already answered your own question from what you have written. If you have no passion for the medical field anymore, you should move on. Perhaps business/finance is something to pursue, IF you have the aptitude.... I would recommend going to the Career Services Office at your school and ask if the Strong Vocational Interest Inventory is available for you to take. Vocational Inventories can help guide you to an occupational area that are suitable to your interests. You might discover something else as a result of feedback from a well validated instrument like the Strong.   In the career counseling field, there is a bromide that goes something like this: do what you love, and the money will follow.   I wish you the best with your future studies and career! "
"Army guy looking for educational help, career wise."," Hi David --   I would like to echo what Mr. Simmons and Dr. Robinson said above --      I would also advise you to take an interest and aptitude inventory to help you begin to determine which direction you’d like your professional career to take.   Similarly, I would also be advise you to begin to develop strong networking relationships – as a part of that process, I’d recommend that you seek to establish strong mentor/mentee relationships with a few individuals who you trust and whose opinions carry weight with you.     I was formerly an artillery officer in the U.S. Army.  I now work for one of world’s largest technology companies.  I had to get through 4 intervening careers (after having left active duty) to find my current professional passion – so I agree with Mr. Simmons’ comment, above, that finding the right profession is a lot like trying on pairs of shoes to find the pair that fits the best.  But, having your own understanding of your professional interests and aptitude (which can be uncovered via taking a formal interest and aptitude inventory), and having a solid network of mentors, can help you find “the right pair” quickly, and hopefully avoid a lot of “blisters” along the way.   I hope this helps! Best of luck in your search for the right profession! "
"Army guy looking for educational help, career wise."," Hey there David,   As a business graduate and a student who is originally studied Radiology before switching majors, I can tell you that the world of business is amazing and can be just as rewarding as being in the medical feild. What is important is that you do what you believe is best. You seem to be aware about your level of interest in your current educational career, but do not be discouraged to test the waters in different areas. As what many have said in previous post, you have done a lot of clear thinking and appears you have answered your own question. If business or economics do not pain out you can always go back to the RN track or try a new field all together.   You are still young and have unique experiences the Army gave you, just take it slow and do not rush through a decision if you have doubts.   Thank you for your service David and hope this helped. Good luck.  "
How long have you been working in the mechanical engineering field?," Hello Dakota,  I have worked overall 15 years in an engineering role for equipment/product design and manufacturing.  I have another 19 years experience using my engineering skills (build, optimization, solves, think logically, assess variables, navigate the unknown, willing to make mistakes and learn from them and get back up,) in supply chain for equipment production and delivery.  What is great about the engineering field is that is trains you how to think and you can take this ability into any area that interests you.  I went into many different jobs all using my engineering skills and some of my lifelong friends stayed as direct engineers at the same company and love it too; however, we all kind of think the same on how to approach challenges in life.

What aspect of college is the most challenging?," Hi Kaylan,   I found the hardest parts of leaving school at age 16 and moving to college (so equates to you leaving high-school and going to a community college) were motivation and discipline. Suddenly you are in the young adult world at 16 or 18 and expected to behave like an adult. Choosing the correct classes are of course very important, however if after the first year you are not enjoying it or want to change classes to a different line of study, then nothing is impossible. Coming from the UK, the costs of education at college (not university which are about £9,000 per year in tuition costs now) were very low. I moved away from home at 17, that was hard, and needed to work part time evenings and weekends to having extra cash for nights out.    You have great scores so far, if you can continue with the high level of concentration, studying and manage the transition into the adult world, then there is no reason why you should not succeed with great results.   As an alternative  My daughter took a year out at 18 and traveled to Madrid for a year and worked as an au-pair. She had studied French, English, Spanish and Chinese at school, wanted to live in Spain for a year before going off to university to study modern languages. She is now at the end of her 3 year course and is currently working unpaid in Spain for a month with a languages school. This is part of her final year and she will need to submit a report next month on how she found the placement, what she did there and what benefits she has learned.    You have probably heard or read elsewhere - you get out what you put in - it is true, I am now 52 and still studying or taking training courses at work and learning new things to push my self and get out of my comfort zone. Of course that is balanced with great family life too.   So, to summarize, motivation, discipline, get your work completed before the deadline and most importantly enjoy what you are doing and have fun !   Best wishes, Robin "

Yes I always advise that any one moving to higher education academia that it is good to be very versatile in your Academia Institutions - If you are in High School enroll in a neighborhood community college now while in High School to begin to receive college credits while in high school. Most community colleges will allow you to take courses online 1 at a time.Once you graduated high school then continue and receive your AA degree graduate you will be at age 20 yrs. old with your 1st degree then transfer out of state to a HBCU for your last 2 yrs. receive your Bachelors Degree graduate you will be 23-24 yrs. old with 2 degrees and then apply to a main stream triple AAA seed university and transfer such as Cal tech, New York Univ,University of NC Chapel Hill to receive your Masters Degree and after graduating you will be around age 28 yrs. old then you want to apply for your Doctoral Studies at and Ivy League University such as Brown Univ., Univ. of Penn., Cornell U., Dartmouth U., Yale or Harvard this allows for you to have a diverse academic curricula vitae'  at              29 years old with your PHD. and your last phase of academia is your Post Doctoral you would like to be a principle Investigator for such Institutions of research such as world renown Johns Hopkins University or Albert Einstein University and you want to complete 1 community service project overseas for 6 months or 1 year after your Post Doctoral at your leisure. 31 yrs old and ready for any PHD career with a salary of 100K to 150K a yr at 31 yrs old  "

"When adults talk about ""making connections"" does it actually help you get a job? When has a connection ever helped you find a job, or advanced your career in any way?", Making connections or networking does not guarantee a job but it can give you a lot of background information with the types of jobs you are applying for. Plus you can see if one of those connections can become your mentor to help you learn more about the industry. The more you know and the more passion you show will help you stand out amongst the other applicants. I would also recommend setting up a LinkedIn profile if you do not feel comfortable using Facebook to network.  
"When adults talk about ""making connections"" does it actually help you get a job? When has a connection ever helped you find a job, or advanced your career in any way?"," Hello!   I think you are asking about how to make authentic connections: I agree that just handing out business cards is probably not the best way to network.   Here is a way I have found to work well: look for a shared interest, if possible a professional shared interest, but personal ones are important too. Do you share similar job duties? a similar vision on where your industry is evolving? a similar frustration on a problem you wish were solved? same customers? same partners? If you can find such a topic, you will find that conversation flows easily and you will then have fewer hesitations sharing business card or accepting a connection on social media.    You can never guarantee that any specific interaction with a human being will lead to your next job, but most of us have experienced that at least one such conversation/connection did indeed open up doors to the next job.

"When adults talk about ""making connections"" does it actually help you get a job?

Many jobs are referred by your connections, my friend John gave my name to a recruiter recently that just called me up today.  Really!  John is one of my connections that I made over ten years ago and we have continued to stay in touch referring each other periodically when a recruiter calls or we hear about a job.  Yes, the value in connections is job referrals but it is also the network of people you will meet and work with over the years.  You will be amazed when you get older at the friends you have made over the years just through work connections.  By the way just yesterday I referred John to another friend of mine that works at Aruba Networks for a job he was trying to fill.  Have fun building your network! "

Do not think of it as ""networking"" or ""connections"" but as ""making friends.""    And it has to be sincere. One ""friend"" calls me every few years to reconnect and that is when I know she is looking for a job. She never sends me a new connection or job lead; she is a taker.    It is karma.

In my case, fortunately, I have never had the need to look for a job, except my first one.  After that, the job opportunities have come to me via the relationships that I developed throughout my career and of course, my reputation as a solid performer. "

To work in top school what are the requirements need for the teacher," Hi Gomathi,   Teacher Eligibility Test for all school teachers in India   Qualifying in a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) is now mandatory for all existing and aspiring primary and middle school teachers in the country, with the passing of the Right To Education Act. The National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE) has published the guidelines for conducting the TET, providing complete details about rationale for the test, eligibility to take the test, the structure and syllabus for the test, the type of questions that would be asked  and the marks required to qualify as a teacher.   To be eligible to take the CTET or any other TET conducted by the states, one has to have a degree in education (B.Ed or D. Ed) or be on the verge of completing a degree in the year of taking the test. Teachers will need to take the TET within a period of 5 years from the time the TET is first notified. This kind of a qualifying test can help improve the quality of teachers right from the recruitment stage.   The Central Government and many States have begun conducting the TET. The Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) was conducted by the CBSE for the first time in June 2011. The next CTET will be held on January 29, 2012. Here is how the CTET web site describes the Test.   It had been inter alia provided that one of the essential qualifications for a person to be eligible for appointment as a teacher in any of the schools referred to in clause (n) of section 2 of the Right To Education Act is that he/ she should pass the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) which will be conducted by the appropriate Government in accordance with the Guidelines framed by the NCTE.   The rationale for including the TET as a minimum qualification for a person to be eligible for appointment as a teacher is as under:   It would bring national standards and benchmark of teacher quality in the recruitment process. It would induce teacher education institutions and students from these institutions to further improve their performance standards. It would send a positive signal to all stakeholders that the Government lays special emphasis on teacher quality.

What is the best way to get a research opportunity as a college freshman?," Arushi, I feel like I was in your exact same place four years ago. We all have those general education requirements which have 250+ students and it can feel totally overwhelming and impossible to have some sort of personal connection to a professor. Relationship building is a vital skill to learn and it will serve you well during your time as a student as well as during your time in the workforce.      1)     If you have not already, you should be sitting towards the front of the room. While it may be tempting to sit in the back with your friends and talk, your professor will see your face and will have a better impression of you if you sit towards  the front.  2)     Participate in class when given the chance. This does not mean be the teacher is pet and suck up to them, but if you are given the chance to answers questions in class or participate in a group discussion, DO SO.  After you raise your hand and participate, your professor will soon learn your name and it is much easier to have a relationship with a given professor if they are able to call you by name.  3)     This really should be number one, but introduce yourself to the professor as soon as you can. Go to their office hours and say hi to them. Tell your professor your name and a little bit about yourself. All professors have office hours so finding 15 minutes to swing by their office for a quick chat really is not that hard to do.  4)     Go to their office hours if you have a question, it will only help and it will further develop your relationship with the professor.      I wish you the best of luck and I hope this helps!!     Best,  Austin    "
What is the best way to get a research opportunity as a college freshman?," Hi Arushi, There are a number of ways you can go about getting some research experience as an undergrad. As Austin pointed out to you, introduce yourself to your professors and let them know of your interest. Even if they are not doing any research at the moment, they may know someone else who is and can keep you in mind for any future possibilities.  Next, check with your college is career center. They can often steer you in the direction of research volunteer opportunities/internships, both on and off campus.  Also, check your college is web pages.  Many colleges have research opportunities either on faculty web pages or a central location such as a ""Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program"" or something like that.  At my undergraduate institution it was called the ""Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities"". So do some general reviewing of your college is web site to see what you can find. I also recommend looking at specific faculty member is web pages to see what their research interests are  - to see if they mesh with something you might be interested in. That can tell you who you might want to approach about possible research assistance type positions .  And lastly, talk with your high school guidance counselor or college academic advisor about your research interests. If they do not know about something off the top of their head,  they can find out what might be available in terms of research experiences.  Below are some websites about how to get involved with research as an undergrad.  Check out the National Science Foundation is (NSF) website for research opportunities for undergrads at locations nationwide. Good luck on the road to research! "
how can i meet people in college?," Hi Keshya,     I will tell you the number of ways which I used and suggested to others:      You can introduce yourself. By saying “Hi myself Keshya. Nice to meet you”. For sure that person will introduce him/herself. Then you can talk about the class, college or subjects.  In college try to take part in the number of activities. Normally, all activities involve group contribution and as a result, it gives chance to all the students to coordinate and communicate with each other.  If you find someone good in a particular subject as that person answers alot in the class. In this case, again you can directly go and talk to the person and say “Hey! You are too good in this subject.” Once that person gives you a friendly response. It’s a right time to ask for help.  Try engaging in small talks. Like “how are you? And all” (Sometimes small talks add alot)  Help others if u find someone needs help.  Last, you will find a person who is just like us. Go and approach them first.      In a nutshell, don’t think a lot. Just go and start the conversation. For sure, you will hesitate in the starting but if your success rate is high (that is, if both of you starts talking) then it will increase your confidence and talking to others will be much easier for you.     Good Luck!     #college #collegelife #collegesuccess "

How do I successfully apply to college?," Working with your school adviser and counseling staff, you should be able to successfully apply with their help.  Also, I would clarify successfully applying to mean that you are applying for a college that would be suited for your career/job aspirations.  Getting to know yourself well enough to determine which career areas are best suited for your personality traits would make your application process and your education/career journey most successful.     Getting to know yourself and how your personality traits relate to people involved in various career opportunities is very important in your decision making process. During my many years in Human Resources and College Recruiting, I ran across too many students who had skipped this very important step and ended up in a job situation which for which they were not well suited. Selecting a career area is like buying a pair of shoes. First you have to be properly fitted for the correct size, and then you need to try on and walk in the various shoe options to determine which is fits the best and is most comfortable for you to wear.

I wanted to know if I can have a career in forensics with biotechnology?," Hi Keshavi,   Biotechnology is used by forensic scientists to collect or process trace evidence such as hair, skin, blood or semen samples, which is found at crime scenes. When a crime is discovered the scene is examined in order to look for clues that will identify suspects and provide evidence for the courts. They must follow strict guidelines while gathering evidence, so that samples are not contaminated or degraded and their analysis is admissible in court.   Crime scene evidence can include a wide variety of substances such as hair, bodily fluids, fibers, paint chips, soils or gunshot residue. For substances to be useful as evidence they are usually compared to similar items from suspects, because of this, particular care is taken to ensure all substance are collected carefully and kept free of contamination.   In some cases, forensic scientists use biotechnology techniques to help detect important evidence. For example, a chemical called luminol, which glows brightly in the presence of blood, is used to detect small amounts of blood that are not visible to the naked eye.     DNA profiling Every individual has unique DNA, making it very useful for identifying people involved in a crime.     DNA can be isolated from a wide range of evidence left at a crime scene – from skin, hair and semen samples to bacteria in dirt!     Analysis of evidence Evidence at a crime scene may only be found in small, trace amounts so forensic scientists use a variety of techniques including microscopic analysis, mass spectrometry, chromatography and DNA analysis.     Once samples have been collected from a crime scene, ESR carry out forensic analysis on them. They might analyse skin, blood or urine looking for the presence of drugs or process DNA evidence in the hope of identifying someone.       Interpreting the evidence The results of these analyses need to be interpreted. This could mean comparing them to a standard reference, such as legal blood-alcohol limits for driving a car, or comparing DNA profiles of victims or suspects.       Presenting the findings The findings may be presented in court, either as a written report or by ESR scientists acting as expert witnesses.

What classes in college do I need to take to get into aerospace engineering?,"Great to hear Luis! We definitely need more engineers!  The best course you can take to get an idea of what its like is definitely Physics. Particularly Physics M (Mechanics) which is how things move. It will give you a rough idea of what classes in Aerospace will be like. You should also definitely consider taking a programming class. Every engineering discipline is now getting more involved with computers. From modeling to writing programs to control things, it is ubiquitous everywhere. I would just take a class to see how you like it. Even a design class using Solidworks or CAD would be great as well since those teach you to model and build things.  Good luck!"
How can I master Time Management?," Hi Mikayla,  I am glad you are thinking about this issue already. Mastering time management in college will not only be helpful with your classes, but also with independent living.  My advice would be to use a planner. It can be whatever you want - phone app, notebook, sticky notes, calendar, etc... You will write your  noto-do' list in this planner. It is important to consider not only homework and study time, but chores and social time as well. For example, if you really want to go to a campus movie showing but you have a test that week, set aside blocks of time to accommodate both. Doing chores and being with friends can take up more time than we realize. Remember - when you start assignments early that leaves opportunities to ask teachers and other students if you need help.  Another practice to combat procrastination is to make sure you are in the right environment. If your dorm has too many distractions for studying, go to the library. You might feel focused and motivated working at your desk with a cup of coffee, or in a study group. Find what is best for you.  Most people have large gaps in the day between classes in college, and may even work a part-time job. Make each minute count - if you have an hour until your next class and you are thinking about walking back to the dorm, consider staying on campus and getting ahead of some homework instead.  It can be hard to keep a decent balance of school, health, social life, and work. But planning and prioritizing ahead will go a long way. Good luck! "
How can I master Time Management?," You will need to focus on stress and time management. In order to manage stress you have to manage your time wisely. &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;You have to set a routine for yourself and stick to it for the most part. Once you get into the groove of a routine it will be much easier for you to manage your time and have enough time for everything you need to do (including relaxing). Make yourself to-do lists on a weekly basis, use Google calendar or a planner to keep track of events, deadlines, and due dates. In addition to setting a routine and sticking to it, plan out relaxing activities into your day. Or set aside a time, after everything is done for the day, that you can have ""me"" time. I have also personally found it essential to not only find time for myself but also make use of that time in a way that is best for me and my holistic wellness. I have found the HeadSpace app to be an essential tool in helping me relax and generally feel more relaxed throughout the day, Guided meditation, even if you have a busy schedule, will make you feel more at ease and relaxed throughout the day as a whole (not just when you have the time to relax and focus on that ""me"" time).&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;Set a routine.Use Google Calendar.Set aside Me TimeWrite weekly to-do lists and use a planner.Find a peaceful and restful activity that will help you feel relaxed.&lt;/span&gt;       "
How can I master Time Management?,"Mikayla,   Time Management is very important skill that you will need during college and beyond. Please make every effort to master this task before you leave for college. Make it your goal to begin now and stick to completing your task. Simply things to do now:  Get up every morning at a set time Make your bed everyday Make a list to organize your daily task Use technology apps to help you!"
How can I master Time Management?,"Use the tools you have available to you. Once you receive your syllabus for each class you are taking, input key dates (tests, paper due dates, etc.) into your phone or calendar. You will then be able to see where key dates overlap and can then work backwards and set up alerts days or weeks out to remind you to work on those projects or study for the exam. Finding a study partner is also helpful so you can both keep each other on track. It is also helpful to block time on your calendar for study time or homework time. For example, every M and W from 4-6PM I work on homework for this class, etc. Best of luck!"
Describe a difficult task you were faced with and how you addressed it.,"Every office has that one person that come to work early and leave late, being a detail person has it perks and not so much.. . When you become that go to person better known as the trouble shooter their is a way to stay a head.  When you working for several managers in a department you can get stress out with all the different demands coming your way. I was chosen to finish a project at the end of the deadline, which was measure in hours down to the last seconds. Do not lose it, just have a plan. Most of the time if this is not your project from the start you can play hero at this point saving the day.  Always be positive in your approach..To manage your tasks effectively, I highly recommend you try a program, such as outlook or any mail services you are comfortable with using. (study all the tips and tricks to get you by faster). When a request come across your desk write an email to yourself (It will serve as a back up of their request) and then you can schedule for time and task time  to be completed or when the issue should be address with that person. Make a folder for all the managers are clients, put all commutations receive from that person in there folder and your responses in case you need reference information. Save and never delete ( you may run into another project in the future that follow the same guidelines  Set task time for your self. what you do in the morning, noon, and closed of day task. schedule those task you did not finish to be  the first on your to do list for the next day. If you have a difficult task or project divide it or break it down in the equal parts. Label each part ABC and write notes in your email under that project. For example, I have a week to this get this done.  Monday work on Part A, Tuesday B etc. The notes you took summarize the notes to add icing the cake and present it with the finish project as a cover letter. If you are projects in parts you can still get your routine work in so that you want fall behind working in part limit you time on one project such as an hour a day so you will be refresh for the new part. Hang in there. Good luck  "
Describe a difficult task you were faced with and how you addressed it.,"Quiana, That sounds like an interview question! They are trying to figure out how you think, your problem-solving skills, ability to act without direction (not having to ask the supervisor what to do), your resourcefulness, etc.  For example: I was assigned to plan an aircraft disaster exercise. I had never assisted in planning one before, nor had I ever attended one, now I was supposed to take the lead! Panic!!!! First: make sure I understood what my manager wanted me to include in this exercise (a lunch for the participants, etc) Second: talk to those who had planned the ones in the previous years! Third: get organized: make lists, spreadsheets, etc. prioritize my work, based on timelines. Fourth: get some help. Select people to assist, based on my knowledge of their skills, and recommendations of others (having the right people on a team is essential to success!) Fifth: delegate, monitor, follow-up check in occasionally with my manager, etc. etc.  Another example: I worked at the airport. At about 4:30 am, construction workers cut the power to half the terminal, knocking out the security alarm system. We needed to get the terminal opened up so the morning flights could take off, but could not allow people access to the fire escapes, due to the alarms not working.  We (the police) did not have enough people to guard all the fire escapes. So, I asked the maintenance foreman if I could use his custodians to guard the doors. He said okay. All flights got out on time, with no breach of security. (I like this example because it shows that I get along with others - he did not have to lend me his crew!)  So basically, when answering these questions, take the STAR approach: What was the SITUATION What TASK did you need to accomplish What ACTION did you take What was the RESULT  I hope this helps! Kim"
Describe a difficult task you were faced with and how you addressed it.,"Dear Quiana,  A recent difficult situation and choice that I made was to go back to school for a graduate certificate while working full time at a demanding job.  I will be honest, it is not easy, but it is worth it.  I would say the best way that I have handled this is by staying calm...taking breaks and meditating has helped tremendously.  Also, not multi-tasking, but giving my 100% full attention to each task whether it be work related, school related, or personal.  Be creative....for example, if I have had to hand in a paper, asking my boss for some flexibility during the day and catching up on work at night.  Lastly, asking for help and not trying to make everything perfect - asking my husband to do the grocery shopping and make dinner once in a while.  Not worrying if my house is clean, etc.  I hope that this is helpful - all the best of luck to you!"
Describe a difficult task you were faced with and how you addressed it.," Initially I had a fear of public speaking. I forced myself to volunteer for projects that gave me cause to publically speak.

What are some good college prep strategies?," From my many years of Human Resources experience and my experiences doing college recruiting, here are very effective strategies that applied to enhance your chances for success in your education/career journey.  It all starts with getting to know yourself better to know how your personality traits relate to various careers.     Getting to know yourself and how your personality traits relate to people involved in various career opportunities is very important in your decision making process. During my many years in Human Resources and College Recruiting, I ran across too many students who had skipped this very important step and ended up in a job situation which for which they were not well suited. Selecting a career area is like buying a pair of shoes. First you have to be properly fitted for the correct size, and then you need to try on and walk in the various shoe options to determine which is fits the best and is most comfortable for you to wear. Following are some important steps which I developed during my career which have been helpful to many . "
What are some good college prep strategies?," Going off to college is a big milestone and a huge life change for most people. It can be a stressful, challenging transition. Preparing yourself ahead of time is a smart move! Luckily, in today’s digital age, it is much easier to get prepared, than ever before.     Here are a few things I wish I had done:   1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Familiarize yourself with campus:  If possible, tour the campus. Learn where your dorm room is, what your dining options are, where your classes are located. Will you catch a bus? Will you have a bike? Will you walk? How far, and what will the weather be like? Figuring out logistics ahead of time will greatly ease your stress on the first couple days at college.   2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare for your new living situation:  If you have the opportunity, take a tour of your dorm room and accommodations, ahead of time. &nbsp;Most colleges furnish a bed, desk, and closet, and there isn’t room for much else. But, most people bring decorations and desk accessories, to personalize their space. A small coffee pot or microwave might be nice to have. If you can’t tour the dorms, check online for pictures and information about the rooms. You may have a roommate for the first time, which can be an adjustment. Can you meet each other, ahead of time? Email or chat? She may not share the same sleep patterns as you, or the same taste in music. Noise-reducing headphones or ear plugs can ease your experience. Make a packing list of the items you’ll need to feel comfortable and at home in your dorm room.   3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solidify connections with home:  Leaving your friends and family can be stressful, so spend some quality time with those you’ll miss most. Exchange new address and contact information, so you can stay in touch. Agree on a time, maybe once a week, to reconnect with a family member, or close friend. Social media, Skype and Facetime are wonderful technologies that make staying in touch easier, these days.   4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get social, and start making new friends:  Social Media Groups are a great way to connect with current students, ask questions, and meet other inbound students, so you can start making friends before you get there. Look for groups who share your interests, and join up with like-minded people. You may even discover people from your hometown who will be attending the same college. Connect with them, so you have a ready-made support system when you get there. Even if you weren’t close friends in high school, those familiar faces will be a welcome sight, during your first couple of weeks at college.      Even though transitions like going off to college can be stressful, if you prepare yourself, and use your support systems, you can enjoy every moment!&nbsp;It is natural to feel homesick, at first, so plan ahead for that, and know that you are not alone. Going off to college can be such a fun, exciting time. Good luck! "
What are the best type of scholarships to enter in?," Great question Sarah. I am sorry no one is answered it yet! In the meantime, I thought I would share a few links to other relevant Q&amp;A on CareerVillage.org that should be super helpful for you to read through.     Take a look at the ""next steps"" section below for a list of sites you should create accounts on if you have not already. Tips:      Dedicate a minimum of 1 hour a day for a few weeks to applying for scholarships and it will go a long way.  Be thoughtful about your entries, just doing the bare minimum is not going to land you any scholarships. It is better to spend more time on each entry to ensure it is well thought out than to rush through to try to enter a bunch. Quality over quantity!!  I recommend writing one STELLAR essay. Chances are you will use it for every scholarship application (potentially only having to make minor edits dependent on what the prompt is). Tell a story that clearly represents who you are and what is important to you. The goal of the essay should be to let the reader in to your life. If you can do that in a genuine and meaningful way you will be considered, I promise! A couple of ideas: Write about the hardest thing you have had to go through in your life or what makes you so passionate about something. Be sure to include lessons you have learned and what you hope to do with that knowledge/experience later in life.  Spend more time finding scholarships that directly pertain to YOU so it cuts down the competition. Look for scholarships in your local community, or that are just for young women, for example. Know what career path you want to pursue? There are probably dozens of scholarship opportunities that are only for students aspiring to follow a specific career path (e.g. STEM, entertainment, sports, design, etc. etc.)      Relevant Q&amp;A on CareerVillage.org you should read:   What financial support can I find to help me pay for college?    How to stand out when applying for scholarships?    What are the chances of winning scholarships?  "
Which celebrity or public figure do you look up to?," I think the person you pick to answer this question says a lot about who you are as a person and what you believe in. In this scenario, I would chose someone who is morals and ethics lined up with mine as those are attributes I would want to showcase to a potential employer and this question is a great way to convey that message.  "
Which celebrity or public figure do you look up to?,"Hi Mireia,  That is a very interesting question, and congratulations on your job interview! I hope it went well--interviews are always great practice. For this question, the first piece of advice I have is to answer honestly. You do not want to say something just because you think it is what they expect or because the answer sounds ""smart."" You want to answer truly for you because that is what is going to make your personality shine through. I would say the reason for this question is to likely determine what is important to you. If you say Kim Kardashian, it could come across that you value fame and fortune over other things. If you say Michael Jordan, it could come across that you value athleticism and hard work. With those things in mind, I recommend picking someone you have a good ""why"" for. Why is that your favorite person? What does that say about who you are? Your answer will depend on what features you want to convey to the interviewer.  Good luck!"
Which celebrity or public figure do you look up to?,"Hi Mireia,  Congratulations on the job interview!   Without knowing the type of job you were applying for and whether or not the question was in any way related to the position, it appears that you may have had an unstructured interview.  In an unstructured interview, they want to hear from you, so a variety of different open ended questions may be asked.  Unstructured interviews are more conversational and less formal than a structured interview.  This type of interview is designed to put you at ease.  While that is the intent, you should be friendly but still maintain professionalism when responding.    In my opinion, this question is an indirect way of finding out about your beliefs, values and influences.  Again, without knowing the job, I am not sure if this is important to the position or more about your personality and/or character.  In answering the question, the best advice I can give you is  to remember that you are there to showcase your best assets.  Therefore, your response should be honest and convey  your best features, skills and qualifications for the job.    Best of luck!  "
Which celebrity or public figure do you look up to?," Hi Mireia,  Congrats on the interview! Whether you felt prepared or surprised by the question, it is great that you had the experience and can now give the question more thought.      Through that question, I believe the interviewer/employer was trying to get a better sense of your values. To ultimately gather whether your values align with the values and mission of the organization. Another reason they may have asked about public figures is to assess your knowledge of current events, news/media, politics, etc.        Some best practices for future interviews would be to review the organization is website for information on their mission, history,  and press/media coverage. Speak on their values, growth, and any affiliations they may have with public figures. Perhaps you can identify a public figure that you admire and equally embodies some of the values or qualities of the organization. Interviewers will be impressed by your research and your response will make it clear that you are the right fit.     Best Wishes,  Amanda  "
Which celebrity or public figure do you look up to?," I agree with what Lindsey and Cindy both stated.  When you are in an interview, they are never just asking questions out of idle curiosity.  The interviewer is trying to find something out about you.  This question may have been asked to get an idea of your values and influences and stated above, but may also just have been to see if you can choose someone and back up your answer with a well thought out reason why you chose that specific person.    In an interview, remember that everything you do from the moment you walk in the door is part of the interview.    Some things to make your self stand out:  1.	Stand up when the interviewer comes to get you from wherever you check in.  2.	Shake their hand and say something to the effect of ""I am very happy to meet you"".  3.	Bring extra resumes.  You may not need them, but you will have them if asked.  4.	Answer thoughtfully.  Take your time and fully answer the question.    5.	Be yourself, but remember you are talking to a potential employer, not your friend.  6.	Prepare by looking at the company website and searching for the company in the news.  7.	Make sure you have a few questions to ask the interviewer.  Ask about a recent acquisition and the impact on the company or ask about some other piece of information you found in your research.    8.	Send a thank you note to the interviewer.       Good luck in your job search! "
Which celebrity or public figure do you look up to?," Hi Mireira!  Great question... it is important to understand that there is no right or wrong answer to this question.  I think interviewers would be looking for a couple of things with this question.  They are likely looking for the  why  you chose a particular celebrity/public figure and the  how  you articulate your reasons for choosing that particular individual.        Different celebrities/public figures mean different things to each individual, so after you have selected who yours is; providing detailed, thoughtful, authentic reasons for your choice is important.  Be concise, confident, and clear....it is  your  answer!  I have seen this mentioned in other responses and I cannot stress enough to be honest..the worst thing you could do is to say something (or chose someone) who you think the interviewer would deem as ""cool"", ""creative"", or ""impressive"".  They are asking this question to understand what  you  are motivated by, and how you can ascertain certain traits from well known public figures that share your values.       If I were asked this question, I might choose John Lennon as we both share(d) a passion for music, human rights, and the anti-war movement.  I could discuss further how my interest in music,  human rights, anit-war, have shaped my values that I carry today, and how it encourages me to keep working at a variety of important goals I have in my life and career.  John Lennon is legacy is something that still lives on today and  encourages many people with a very hopeful message.   I hope this helps!  Continue to remain curious and humble, and you will be just fine.  Good Luck! "
Which celebrity or public figure do you look up to?, I look up to strong advocates for human rights. I tend to research celebrities off the stage to see who they are when they are not performing. It makes it easier for me to support their art if I have a better idea that they are a good person.  
What is future?," Everybody is a Genius. But If You Judge a Fish by Its Ability to Climb a Tree, It Will Live Its Whole Life Believing that It is Stupid.  That is credited to Albert Einstein, maybe correctly, maybe not.  The point is, there are lots of hurdles in life, and unfortunately, we all can not be good at everything. So, if it is something you absolutely MUST do, like pass Algebra II, then you sit back, regroup and figure out how you are going to do it. Perhaps work with a tutor, etc.  If it is something you do not have to do, and you are certain it is not for you, such as being a gymnast, honestly, it is okay to  quit!     But, you do not want to quit too often. You will develop strength and resilience that will see you through life -there are more of these obstacles headed your way as you navigate through life. The better you learn to keep going now, the better you will be at them later. For example, I have observed that the first thing that happens when a person loses their job is the car breaks down. It is just that way.  So developing strength of character now is important.     If you keep trying to do the same thing, and keep failing, I recommend you talk to a counselor. Or even post the problem here. There is a lot of wisdom at your disposal. There is no shame in asking for help! I find that when presenting a problem to a group of friends, I get some good ideas!     Best of luck!  Kim       "
What is future?, I know this will sound strange but the future starts new every day.  Life was never meant to be easy but the fact that you talk about it shows that you want to do better.  You mention that you keep making the same mistakes over and over; I feel I was doing that too when I was a teenager. Then I learned that the more value I found in myself the less I made mistake because I became focused on what truly matter: me. Remember that every day you make a difference in someone’s life. You did in mine today. #Umatter 
Should I go for my masters in Finance?," I would highly recommend getting as much education as you can.  Many employers look at a master is degree the same way they saw an undergrad degree 20 years ago. So if you want to give yourself the most opportunities, get the most education. "
Should I go for my masters in Finance?," Definitely! If you are already in school going for your undergraduate degree, it will not be a hard transition going for your Masters. You are already in ""school mode"" so you can see it through. I was going to get my Masters in business administration back in 2009 when I graduated with my undergrad degree. I decided to wait and I still have not gone back and it is almost 10 years later.  Do not be like me. Go get that Masters! "
Should I go for my masters in Finance?, I would say yes many companies look for this and a higher education does not hurt to have.

What are the qualities that an engineer should have in order to be successful?," Hi Mariana (from Katy, Tx...I am from Texas as well),  To put it simply, you have to like solving problems. And you have to be curious to ask questions (as you did in this forum). Of course, in our toolbox as engineers is a whole heap of Math so there is no getting around that. Finally, over the years and across many projects, it becomes more and more apparent that you have to have awesome honesty and character as the solutions you put in place will affect others. So study hard, ask questions and take advantage of every STEM opportunity that you can.     I hope this helps you along your journey....thx for you question :) "

What can I do with a bachelors in biology? I can really use some help," What part of biology do you  love? Biology is a huge field and encompasses so much. There was a lot of biology that I did not excel in (micro and cell biology) but I love ecology and physiology. By narrowing down what you love, you can began to look into jobs and internships to get information for a direction on your life. You may enjoy lab life or prefer to work in a state park or take water samples from urban streams. The sky is the limit with your degree! "
What can I do with a bachelors in biology? I can really use some help," Pricilla,  How great that you love biology! I do, too. It was my undergraduate major. If I had not gone to graduate school I was considering working in a laboratory as a technician. Some very enterprising people who have a biology degree go into pharmaceutical sales. There are also jobs in county or local government park and water departments. I have attached a page from the Occupational Outlook Handbook to give you some ideas. If you cannot get a job in your field, volunteer in a lab or environmental center part time until you have experience and references to help you land a job. "
Without much schooling ?," Depending on how quickly you want to earn that 6 figures, you might consider a job on the commercial side of the medical field, say in sales, marketing, PR, advertising, etc.  Entry into those positions usually requires a bachelor is degree (4 years) although for advancement you may want to add on an MBA (2-3 years).  For example, you could get an account executive position after college in a medical/pharmaceutical advertising agency, earning $40-50k, and work your way up to account director making $100k after a few successful years based on hard work.

If you are trying to make a field switch (say math to engineering) what advice do you have for a smooth transition?," Transition from Math to engineering might not be a tough one, given that you are completing a major in math. I know a friend, who did masters in Math and then Masters in Chemical engineering. Please follow the advise of Deborah Frangquist (discuss with your advisor).     In my perspective, although it is not hard, growing technological issues are demanding a faster and better solutions and most widely used method to deal with the issue is to develop models (these will save resources, time and energy). These might be very complex in nature and I am sure that your math knowledge is going to help a research group that does both experimental and modeling. In this way, you can use your math background to the advantage of solving an engineering issue and working with the engineers also gives you an opportunity to learn the thought process. There will be opportunities for you in organizations like Wolfram and Mathworks.   Pls check the following link also   https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3489-what-does-mechanical-engineering-have-to-do-with-data-science   Hope it is going to help. "
If you are trying to make a field switch (say math to engineering) what advice do you have for a smooth transition?," If you really want a career in engineering, probably you will need to take the time to get a degree in the field, either a graduate degree or a second bachelor is degree. But you might look into first working for an engineering company in a role which uses your math knowledge. That way you will learn a certain amount of how engineers think and a certain amount of professional vocabulary even if you are working as a mathematical analyst or statistician.    There are a couple of things you can do in your senior year which will probably help you make the transition either to engineering graduate school or to a job related to engineering:  If you have choices in your class projects, pick topics which relate to industrial engineering. Those might be in statistics or stress analysis or other complex analysis. Meanwhile, get to know faculty and senior majors in industrial engineering, if you have not already built those connections. Talk to faculty both in math and in engineering about how mathematics can be used in engineering. Again, this will help you learn to think like an engineer and will help you learn basic concepts and vocabulary. All of that will help you decide whether to immediately pursue another degree. It will also help you succeed either in applying for jobs or in applying to graduate school. "
If you are trying to make a field switch (say math to engineering) what advice do you have for a smooth transition?," It is not the only way, but math bachelors are a bit limited with what you can do with them. Unfortunately, switching to engineering would add some good time to your degree. Joining an engineering graduate program after you get your math bachelors is going to be challenging too. I suggest you to talk to your adviser. He would tell you exactly how time the first scenario would cost you and the likelihood of the second one. I am going to leave you with a couple of links about the careers that you could follow with math bachelors.   http://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/careers-advice/what-can-you-do-mathematics-degree http://study.com/articles/Jobs_and_Salary_Info_for_a_Bachelors_Degree_in_Mathematics.html "
what other strengths or experiences might I need for becoming an RN or a Surgeon?," Hellos,  The strength of any individual is their tolerance and patience level.  How much you become tolerant and add patience into you it will change the graph of your life.     Thank you "
Why are women and minorities historically underrepresented in the Foreign Service?," I can not answer why, but I will try to share some of what they are doing to help.  Historically like many government institutions only white men were allowed, when women began serving they only could serve if they were unmarried.  The Department is trying to correct that these days by actively recruiting minorities and women.  They still are not where they should be or where lots of people want them to be, but they are trying.  I think part of it is that a lot of people do not know about them.  I can say when I first starting working at State and I would tell people they would ask me which state.  That is the first problem, most people do not know what the State Department has to do with the rest of America and think of it as a Washington elite.  I think in the past a lot of people that did the recruiting also only went to the same places and targeted the same people.  I am not sure if they are doing a better job at that or not and I do not think it is my place to judge that, but I know a lot of good people that work there that think that diversity is needed and will only make the department stronger.  I am not sure that this helps much, but here are some resources for you to understand more about the history of it if you want to do your own research:  https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/22/state-department-race-gender-diversity-susan-rice-kerry/   http://www.afsa.org/foreign-service-women-today-palmer-case-and-beyond  http://www.usdiplomacy.org/history/service/representative.php    "
"How would you go about asking for a pay raise based on your work experience, level of education, and skill set without risking your career?", My recommendation is that you research salaries based on the job you are interested in and ask for a salary in that range based on your experience. If you have a lot of experience you can ask for a higher salary.  Do not be afraid to negotiate.  
Grad school vs. undergrad," If you are comparing Masters programs to undergraduate degrees, I do not think there is that much difference.  Most Masters programs are predominantly classwork, like your undergraduate degree, an possible a smaller research project.  The main difference is the classes are increasingly specialized.   The PhD, however, is a different animal.  A PhD should be focused on research, not taking classes.  Although you will take some classes as part of a PhD program, the emphasis is on doing research.  This can take a little getting used to, after spending so much of your education taking classes, but if you love research, can be very fulfilling.  Depending on the research group, you will also work much more closely with your advisor.     Finally, here is a short description I once heard about how your degrees change you.  ""When you get your Bachelors degree, you think you know everything.  When you get your Masters, you realize you do not know everything.  When you get a PhD, you realize nobody knows anything."" "
Grad school vs. undergrad," Hello,   I personally found Grad school easier and more rewarding.  Here is the difference.  As an under-grad your horizons have not been expanded and you lack a developed ability to use and understand abstract thought.  This in no way means you are dumb or something bad like that.  It means you are un-focused.  For many folks it is the first time they have been away from home.....   and they loss their minds.     Under-grads tend to have ineffective study habits and perhaps some other bad habits....................  In grad school, there are generally no scholarships and the like, so you yourself are paying for the education.  Most people have to work full-time jobs and may have already started a family.  It is tough, but it can be done if you are organized.   The biggest difference I noted was that you are treated as an adult, not a kid just out of high school.  There are no academic secrets and the professors tended to be a cut above the rest....  at least when they were instructing grad students.   Lastly, I will share that you should not stop or take a break or any of that.....   it is real hard to start up again.  Think about those things in motion tending to stay in motion and contrast that with how much energy it takes to get a sedentary object into motion versus sustaining the motion.   Good luck JD "
Can I be a OB/GYN Nurse if I major in Biology?,"In order to become a registered nurse in the U.S, you need to attend an accredited nursing program. So, for example, you can not major in Biology and then simply take the RN licensing exam (NCLEX) and be considered a nurse.   You can, however, earn a degree in Biology and then attend a different school for a ""second degree"" nursing program-- programs that allow people who already have a bachelor is degree to quickly earn a bachelor is or master is degree in nursing (1-3 years). This is what I did, but this route does not really make sense if you are already certain that you want to become a nurse. Can you tell me a little more about your school & career goals? Are you just dabbling with the idea that you might want to be a nurse? Are you debating nursing vs. medical school?"
How do you go about getting an athletic scholarship?," Hi Destyni, great question! I played several sports in college and ended up getting an athletic scholarship to run track and cross country in college. If you are a junior in high school, I would recommend making a list of colleges that you are interested in. If you have a favorite, consider attending their summer camp (most schools have one) to get an opportunity to talk to the coach. My recommendation  would be to reach out to the head coach &amp; assistance coach (or the coach for your event in track) directly. When you send a note to them it would be good to include a few highlights about your stats. For example, for track it would be helpful for the coach to know your personal best times, your best performances at conference, sectional, and state. If you are looking at out of state schools, consider giving more clarity regarding your background, as they likely will not know how competitive your conference/region is. Further, when reaching out to the coaches, I recommend discussing why you are interested in the school and athletic program and wait until you hear back from them to discuss the possibility of a scholarship.  I hope this helps and good luck with your season and your college search. "
What is the most important factor when looking into a buying a laptop for school?," Hello!   In addition to some other responses that I agree with, I would factor in durability/warrenty, student discount packages (if your instituiton offers it), and any personal preference. Some institutions require certain software or a particular type of computer for students to have. For example, at Lesley University College of Art and Design often have their computers equiped with design software. At Wentworth Insitute of Technlogy, they require students to have a laptop and will cycle out the laptops every two years. This is part of their tuititon and students are told about this upfront before they apply. I would check with your school is Information Technology department to see if there are any requirments or discounts that your school may offer. Sometimes, this is worth purchasing through your school becasue they may offer tech supportf if you need it in the future. This could save you time and money by not having to go through the computer manufactor company if something happens to your computer.  "
What is the most important factor when looking into a buying a laptop for school?," Charles gave some awesome guidelines above, I will try not to repeat much of what he said but I make no promises!    Based on the description, I am going to guess that you are shopping for a laptop on a budget so I will rule out more high end/expensive options such as a MacBook.    I am not sure what your main tasks on the laptop will be but from my experience in college, the majority of it was used to do homework, write essays, check email and general usage (surfing the web, watching netflix). I will form my answer by finding something that is affordable and will easily meet those needs listed above. One thing to note is that if you can, it is usually worth spending the extra $100-200 to get a bit of a higher end machine so it could potentially last throughout your college career.    I just recently found myself in the market for a new laptop and I set myself a limit of $600 - I relied heavily on this article for most of my research, I think you will find it helpful as well: http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/how-to-buy-a-budget-laptop/   - This related article will probably be some help as well, http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/what-laptop-should-i-buy-the-best-laptops-for-every-need/   As Charles said, you are a student so you do not need or want the latest and greatest. I would say you want at least 4GB of memory and probably 256GB+ of hard drive space (You will probably have a hard time filling it up unless you plan on storing a bunch of music and video on the laptop. Your average essay is not going to take up any space at all). I would recommend going for ani5 processor, or similar. There is really no reason you need to go up to an i7 for what the average college student is using the laptop for. Beyond that, most everything will be preference (backlit keyboard, screen size, weight etc). I would also agree with Charles that you will want to get a reputable brand (Dell, Acer, HP etc) that will be able to provide you with good customer support should something break.    I found myself going with wirecutter is suggest of the $550 Acer laptop from the first link above, I have had no complaints with it so far. Feel free to leave any comments if you need clarification on anything.    Happy shopping and congratulations on the scholarship!  "
What is the most important factor when looking into a buying a laptop for school?," in my experience, you want to get a laptop you do not mind losing.  Yours may just get stolen, or it may take a tumble down stairs and get smashed up.    This means, spend less than half your money on the laptop, save about the same amount for getting a replacement, and then spend a reasonable amount on accessories to improve your experience (backpack that holds a laptop, perhaps with wheels, flash drives to create your system restore disks on (32 gigabytes last I checked), and external hard drive for extra storage that is more portable than your laptop and more reliable than a flash drives), two pair of good comfortable headphones/headsets, a cloud backup service, so that when you lose your laptop, you do not lose the data.)  Use your flash drives for data transfer, not data storage. Be careful that your personal data is encrypted on your external drive and is not unencrypted on your machine is hard drive,    Get a more expensive printer that does not use expensive ink (chose a brand and model that has ink for a low price per page). Find a reliable online place to buy generic ink from, that also sells other things and offers free shipping sometimes.   Consider saving enough money to get a new battery and a new power cord/battery charger. Batteries wear out. Will you need a car charger (from the 12 volt battery? )     Make sure you have the software you will be using. Microsoft Office Home and Student (or similar cloud based) is practically required. Do not use the generic Open Office or Libre Office unless you know there will not be issues.  I tried that. When I transferred from Libre office back to Microsoft office, there was formatting issues.     Make sure you have virus protection software.   Shop around and get the laptop that does what you are going to need in the next two years.  You are a student, so there is no need to buy the latest, fastest, hardware with the most hard drive space and most RAM.  But maintenance is very important.  As a student, you will be rough on your laptop.  Get a reliable brand and learn to take care of it so as to not break it. Then if you have outgrown your laptop in two years, get another one that is newer and better. In my mind, there is no reason to spend over $400 for a laptop.  You can get one that works fine for less than $300 (probably refurbished). Get one that can be maintained locally (a major national brand), so you can take it into the shop and have it fixed while you wait or leave it for a few days. do not let them ship it out.   Do i sound a bit paranoid about losing the computer?  I broke my power cord connector in the computer - it had to be re-soldered on the main board.  It was an off-brand laptop that was only serviced in one city, that I did not live in. It was dead and I sent it to them.  They lost it between the store I sent it to and their warehouse where they repaired it. and I had not backed up my data, so I lost it all.  Yes, they gave me a replacement machine, but it was an old used one, same age or older than the one I lost and all my data was gone.    hope this helps. "
What is the most important factor when looking into a buying a laptop for school?," Depending on your lifestyle I would say durability, and battery life is always important.   What you use it for will really help you figure out the programs that you will use more, maybe you want a little mix of fun with it?  Maybe PC or Mac is a big issue for you?     I would recommend one that is portable easily for you and kind of has that right ""feel"" to it.     Also using programs that make sense for you and have storage for you and a backup plan for important papers and projects.  Office, Google Drive, Office 365, Docs, Classroom, blackboard are all programs you may encounter and find useful.   My best to you!   Troy :) "
I want to become a fashion designer. Please give me advice on how to get there? Is it a good career?,"Hi Famina, My apologies for my late response! I will tell you that the dynamics of the apparel industry have changed over the years- like anything, there are less companies. No matter...I would imagine that you are high school? I am from Boston so needless to say that there are some really good opportunities for this type of education- RISD, School of Fashion Design, I am not sure what state universities offer as major in this field and of course school s in NYC,  etc. Hopefully, you love clothes, have a good eye as to what looks good on yourself or someone, being creative. A lot of the European fashion is not worn here as it is too fashion forward though you can get your inspiration from this! I find this to be a visual field...what colors work together, how clothes fit (or do not fit) a person. I used to go into stores to see how garments were sewn- any special seam finishes, types of stitches. Feel the fabrics. Do you like to design and sew clothes for yourself or others? I have worked mostly in the technical side of design (as opposed to the creative/ design)- patternmaker, tech designer, production coordinator. NYC still has most of the opportunities  though most of the sneaker companies are in Boston. Prior to next summer, see if you can work at a company, like an internship, to get a taste of what goes on in manufacturing. If you want to contact me again, lease feel free! Best, Nancy "

What do I major in to become a secondary teacher?," There are two common paths for this career field. You can either major in secondary education from the beginning, meaning for your bachelors degree, with an area of study, i.e. math, english, science, etc. If you plan on getting a masters  degree, many people prefer to major in their area of study for their bachelors and then get a masters in education.  "
What do I major in to become a secondary teacher?," You will need an education major,  grades 7-12 plus a major in a topic you are interested in teaching to students, Math, a world language, English, Science to name just a few.

"Is it ever too late to change careers? If so, what can you do if you aren’t satisfied with your career? If not, how can I prepare myself for the change?","I dare say it is never too late to change careers!  There are certainly some career paths that are easier or more approachable if you are young, or if you start them young: age 70 is probably too late to start trying to become an astronaut.  But I know many, many people who went to graduate school for one field and then in their 30s or 40s said ""No, I think I would rather do something else""--and went to do that other thing!  Different career changes require different kinds of work, of course.  If you have been working as a research biologist for ten years and decide you want to go to medical school, you can probably apply to medical school (I assume; I do not know what research biologists actually do!), whereas if you have been working as a novelist for ten years and decide you want to go to medical school, you will probably need to brush up on some biology and chemistry before applying.   And going from ""novelist"" to ""doctor"" takes many years of additional education, whereas going from ""doctor"" to ""novelist"" does not take much more than a lot of determination.  You ask about ""preparing yourself"" for changing fields; what kind of preparation you might want would depend a lot on the field.  If you know you might want to go to medical school, you may find yourself trying to keep up your knowledge of biology rather than (like me) forgetting all of it the moment the class was over.  If you think you might quit law school to become a programmer, you might keep your programming skills active by working on personal programming projects.  Overall, though, changing careers should not be a scary step.  I have known people who started out working in computers, one way or another, and then decided to quit the tech industry and get degrees in library science, children is literature, or veterinary medicine.  I went the other direction, getting a degree in an academic field and teaching for a while before stepping away from that and looking for programming work instead.  My brother trained as a journalist, decided he did not like it and started teaching high school, and ten years later decided he would gotten everything from that that he could and went back to school for an MBA.  People change careers all the time, so do not be afraid to pick one, even knowing you might decide you do not like it and want to do something else instead.  "
"Is it ever too late to change careers? If so, what can you do if you aren’t satisfied with your career? If not, how can I prepare myself for the change?",Never too late! Many people have 3 or 4 careers in their lifetime. I am on my 3rd now. All successful. Just sometimes we need to change and grow.   Good luck to you and never ever make decisions out of fear.

Biochemical Engineering from Biochemistry Degree,"  I would also be more than happy to go abroad (Iv been learning Japanese for about a year and know my way around Tokyo).  #graduate #biochemistry #bioengineering #graduate-recruitment #working-abroad. Dear Sean,                   Biochemical engineering is about applying principles of chemical engineering such as mass transfer, heat transfer, process design, reactor design, fluid properties , impeller design in biotechnology.  The entry requirements for MSc Biochemical engineering at University College London are as follows:    Normal entry requirements are at least a second-class Bachelor is degree from a UK university or the equivalent from an approved overseas institution. As with any engineering discipline numeracy skills are important for the quantitative description of biological and physical phenomena. Evidence of numerical ability is requested as either an A level in Mathematics (or in exceptional cases, in Physics) or some mathematics studied at university. The department provides mathematics tutoring for Master is students throughout the year adjusted to a candidate is ability. Hope this helps. Good luck. "

I want to go to business school. What are some key things I should do to prepare myself?," Hi Kyle,   I like your forward thinking approach. Having attended b-school myself, in hindsight here are few things I suggest that you do to prepare yourself.     Do tons of research to see which b-school best fits you and that aligns with your area of interest.   See whether you would like to do a general MBA or specialize in a certain area - this is another factor for you to zero down on the school   Align and diversify your classes and any internships to not just your area of interest but also to see how well it can complement your focus area. For example, if you are wanting to focus in marketing, then any exposure to sales or finance can always be a good add-on.   Of course prepare for GMAT   Ensure you have extra curricular, volunteering and all things that will make you stand out .     All the best. Shruti  "
What should I expect in the Computer Science field?," Computer science is (quite fortunately) a very broad and deep area of study, and can afford you opportunities in a broad number of fields. For example, I have leveraged my computer science degree in order to build a career in consumer software development (more specifically: web-based software development). A number of my friends have used their degrees to become quality assurance engineers, professors, network engineers, and entrepreneurs.   The most common work-related skill that will be required of a computer scientist is the ability to read, write, and manage quality code. The most common programming languages that I have encountered in my years as a web-focused software engineer are Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby; however, there are a vast number of additional languages in the various technical fields that are creating demand for competent developers that can specialize.   Since the majority of programming languages adhere to the same core principles of construction, it is rarely an insurmountable challenge to learn an additional programming language. My recommendation is to begin learning a language that is innately object-oriented and has a significant amount of developer assistance tools (such as Java). Once you begin to understand the nuances of how good code is structured, it will be easier to transfer those core skills to the learning of another language. All good university curriculums will focus the majority of your effort on learning these fundamentals (as opposed to simply teaching you the ins-and-outs of any specific language).  "
What should I expect in the Computer Science field?," I agree with Bryan is answer but would like to add that you should probably also have a solid background in Algorithms and Data Structures, no matter which particular career or which programming language you end up choosing.    First, a lot of basic algorithms and data structures are actually being used on a daily basis even in the coolest tech companies, and second, getting a solid understanding of these will help you develop a ""computer science"" way of thinking (how do you develop an algorithm to solve a particular problem? how do you tell if an algorithm is good? what are some of the limitations when developing computer programs? etc.). It is a lot about math in general, but then you also need to be able to translate your ideas efficiently into code.  "
What should I expect in the Computer Science field?," A bachelors of science in Computer Science is usually a breadth degree, so you take courses in a bunch of different fields of computer science such as OS, Networking, Databases, Artificial Intelligence, Compliers, Programming.

What is the life of a solar engineer like?," Hi Catterina,   As a mechanical engineer, I have worked on several solar power projects in the past. Indeed, it is fulfilling work to build power plants that use solar energy to heat water into steam to drive a steam turbine generator. Designing the steam turbine to handle varying steam conditions pose interesting problems that the engineer must solve. Renewable energy in general is an exciting field even so given it is limitations. To become a solar engineer, you would major in either electrical or mechanical engineering and then try to find a job in the power industry in regions where solar energy and wind energy are growing. Because renewable energy is limited in its application (i.e., sunny areas like southern California, Arizona, New Mexico for solar projects and windy areas for wind power such as the mid-Atlantic states), the job market will be a bit more competitive. But, do not let that sway you, by the time you graduate, we may have an energy policy that places renewable energy as a priority. In the meantime, engineering is a tough major but, if I did it, so can you. It is tough because it requires some more discipline than other non-STEM majors. It also requires time, dedication, and the desire to learn how to solve problems that confront society. If you have such an extreme interest in renewable energy and engineering, I do not think it will be too difficult for you at all. As you prepare for college, get as much exposure to mathematics, physics and solar energy as possible. Also, be sure to learn some fundamentals of the business side of solar power. Here are some useful links for you:   On working as a solar engineer: http://www.environmentalscience.org/career/solar-engineer On the solar power industry: http://www.seia.org/research-resources/major-solar-projects-list On solar energy in general: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power A project I worked on: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Solar_Project   Good luck to you!

How can I become the next LeBron James?," I can not promise you that you will become as good as LeBron James but if you want to become a good basketball player you need to practice, and practice the right way.   Find a local program or a local coach and let them teach you the correct forms and the correct techniques of basketball and then dedicate yourself to practicing and perfecting. It will take lots of time and dedication to the game, at times it wont be ""fun"" but you will improve. Push yourself daily to do each technique perfectly.   Study the game, watch basketball at all levels and become a smart player, watch what players  do right, watch what they do wrong. Learn from other players so that you can adapt your game to make the right decisions.   Take care of your body. Eat right, drink water (cut out the Soda), exercise every day and push yourself.   Good Luck. "
do you need to have a lot of work experience to get a gob more easily?," Ethan, I would say quality over quantity is what matters most. Having 20 jobs may seem impressive, but if they do not relate to the job that you are applying for then they are pretty much useless. Having worked jobs that pertain to what you are applying for and having work experience that teaches you valuable skills that can be used in your new job is what is the most valuable thing.      Do not worry about not having years of work experience, you are better off with a few internships and jobs that are relevant over numerous insignificant jobs/internships.       Best,  Austin     "
How long do you have to go to school to become a diesel mechanic?," You can become a diesel through a technical school or even an apprenticeship program. If you go to a technical or trade school it can take from 1-4 years depending on how comprehensive a program you attend.  You will need, or will be taught, basic math, science and writing skills along with actual hands-on skills in any of these programs.  Some diesel manufacturers have training programs also.  We are in dire need of good technical people who repair heavy machinery.  The pay is general very good although the hours can be demanding. Good luck.  "

What how can I get or find other scholarship or grant programs for college?,"Hi Monica,  Do not give up just yet. Go to your school is financial aid office and see what other options you have to pay for school. You can also get in contact with your school alumni affairs office and ask if there are any scholarships/assistance available as alumni have their own scholarships that they award new and current students.  You can also do an online search to see what is available as well.  Do not throw in the towel just yet. There are always options. "
What how can I get or find other scholarship or grant programs for college?,"HI!  Each university offers scholarships specific to their school, and sometimes even your major.  Beyond that, and because I have done this with 2 of my own children, you should seek outside scholarships based on need and merit. Some of the big ones are Coca-Cola, Ronald McDonald, and the Gates Foundation.  (you can google these) Additionally, there may be scholarships that you can find via Google, based on your race, gender,  or being the descendant of a veteran (these are just examples).  Also, you can go to the library and get books on scholarships, grants and fellowships.  I found these very helpful, as they were broken down by university, major, and specifics like ethnicity.  Last, try some of the websites to help you search for more college money!  Good luck and remember all the scholarship deadlines are coming up soon!    www.fastweb.com/Scholarships www.collegescholarships.org https://www.scholarships.com"
What is a job in mathematics," This is a great question. I actually decided to change my major to Mathematics from Dental Hygiene/Business Administration. I met with my adviser to have a better understanding of what potential careers would be. When I met and asked her what I could do, she looked me in the eyes and told me anything I wanted - that Mathematics opens so many doors.  She actually gave me a few things to research, one book being ""101 careers in Mathematics"". This may be a resource to you as you continue to do research.     I decided to major in Mathematics, and minor in Business Administration, therefore I could work within Business and have that Mathematics background that would appeal to companies. I originally thought about Actuary work but after research decided it was not for me, and opened my search to Financial Analyst work where I was able to find opportunities.     There are so many Pro is to careers with a Mathematics background. This degree enables you to think and look at situations differently compared to other people.It is appealing to companies and hiring managers.    "
What is a job in mathematics," You might want to check out the website BeAnActuary (http://beanactuary.org)  #beanactuary . An actuary is a business professional who evaluates risk, often in an insurance company. There are also more nontraditional opportunities for actuaries because risk is so much a part of modern life.     If you like what you see on the website you should know that you need to be a self starter as an actuary, so you can pass the exams required to get the credentials while you are also working in a business environment. But you do not have to go to school beyond an undergraduate degree to get these credentials. "
What are the personality traits required for someone who wishes to pursue in Psychology?," I would agree with Jennifer is response.  You can do a lot of things when you are a psychologist.  There are many different types of psychologists, but most people think of a therapist.     Before you can become a therapist, you will undergo considerable training to prepare you.  The training will help you develop skills that are necessary for the job.  Personality is less important than your ability to learn those things that will help you do your job.  As any healthcare provider, being a therapist tends to attract people who want to help others and who have considerable empathy.     Hope this helps. "
What are the personality traits required for someone who wishes to pursue in Psychology?," In some ways, it depends what you want to do in psychology. Do you want to be a therapist, or would you prefer to do research? Do you want to become a professor, or go to medical school and become a doctor? All of these areas will have you interacting with people, but in very different ways. Therapists and doctors are taking care of people, whereas researchers are studying and learning about people (and usually welcoming them into the lab to do their studies). These professional interactions are different from simply socializing, but they do require warm interaction with others.   Other traits that are important are being hardworking and persistent, while also being able to admit when you are wrong. These traits will benefit you in almost any career. And, of course, you will be better in your career if you love what you are doing. "
Why do colleges reject students?How do you pick the best college that suits you.," Hi Franceska!     Sorry to hear about your top choice but congrats on getting into others! I wanted to reply to this question because the same thing happened to me. I was rejected by my top choice but after 4 years at the college I ended up at, I cannot imagine going anywhere else and honestly I am so thankful I was rejected because I would not have had the amazing experience I did. So I just wanted to remind you not to lose hope and to say just because you did not get into your dream school does not mean that college will not be the best four years of your life.     It is definitely important when considering your other options to think about what you want to major it, what your interests are, but it is also important to remember college is what you make of it. You want to find a campus that you feel comfortable at and can relate to other students, but a lot of that comes from being involved. No matter what school you decide on, put your whole self into being there and being a part of the campus and the life there. For me, what ended up meaning the most and contributing to my love of my school the most were experiences I had outside of the classroom. Yes, the skills and knowledge I gained in class helped me in my career and were my focus on campus. But what made the experience and what I will hold onto was the campus community and the connections I made there.      Hope this helps! Good luck with your decision! "
Why do colleges reject students?How do you pick the best college that suits you.," A college, just as a career, is an individual match for each person.  The first step is getting to know yourself.  During my many years in Human Relations and College Recruiting, I have found that too many students have neglected this very important point and have ended up in  a job (the practical application of their major area of study) and found that they did not like it or were not comfortable with it because they had missed that important step of getting to know their personality traits and matching them with an appropriate major.

How can you tell which scholarships are requitable?

Find a school you want to attend and ask their financial assistance department how you can get the grants&nbsp;you need to go to that school.&nbsp;They may also be aware of grants you did not know about.     You could also ask your church if they have any grant money available for your college or ask your parents if they would be willing to take out a loan to help you.     Choosing a junior college for your first two or three years can also make the cost lower and that is what I did.&nbsp; I had summer jobs that paid for junior college, and I got through the rest of my degree with 1) Pell Grant, 2) a fund provided by my church (it was a loan but it was a low-interest loan), and 3) a Parent Plus loan which was another low-interest loan my parents took out in their name.

How long did it take until you got your first job during high school? Or did you at all? Is the moment to get a first job during high school or post secondary?," HI,  In my opinion you are behind your peers.  Extra curricular activities are nice, but unless you are really good at one of them, chances are that once you get out of HS, nobody will care.  That first job, regardless of what it is, teaches a young person a lot about the working world and how to relate to co workers, the boss, customers  and so many other things that you just do not get anyplace else.  Part time work can also be fun, depending upon your likes and attitude and can possibly give you some idea of what you might like to do in college and the working world beyond collage.     Think about it, two people are applying for a job with identical  backgrounds and educational credentials, one has no work experience and the other does - who are you going to pick if you were the hiring manager?    Good luck, "
How long did it take until you got your first job during high school? Or did you at all? Is the moment to get a first job during high school or post secondary?," Any experience is great experience!  It is never too late to start, but I would look into getting a job sooner rather than later.  Although the actual position might not be what you want for a career, it shows the development of much needed soft skills.  Employers want to know you are able to do things, such as:  clocking in and out on time, showing up for work, having a reliable work history, reporting to a supervisor, etc.  The sooner you start your work history the better.  Work Experience speaks wonders to any hiring manager and could just put you over the top when it comes to finding/starting your career!  When/if you go to college, look into various campus positions.  These could be a great way to gain much needed experience.   "

Should I enter college right after high school if I do not know what I wish to major in?," The ""gap"" year has actually gained some traction here in the US as of late (as exemplified and more publicly discussed by the fact that President Obama is eldest daughter has announced her intention to do so).   My opinion, if there is something you are looking forward to do, and you feel as if it will help you either better appreciate what you do or make a better decision ahead of what you want to or plan to do, then go for it.  Just be prepared to think about how that year off has benefited you, and what your story will be to explain how it furthered your growth.  You should always be moving forward, and whether college is your next step, immediately or after time off, or is irrelevant.  Whatever your next step is should be a building block for what you plan to do.   "
Should I enter college right after high school if I do not know what I wish to major in?," This is a great question because there are so many ways to answer it.  Honestly, the values I grew up measured our family is spend on college to what was expected on the other side.  Hence, I had to come up with a major quickly my first semester because I had gone in without one.  If you honestly have looked into the different majors your choice of university is offers (I am assuming you have got 2-5 undergrad programs you are looking at) but still unable to isolate what you might be interested in, then my thought...  Why not take a semester or a year off?  I look back at all the energy and time I had back then and wish I could have had the courage to take some time to go off the beaten path.  Now the other important question, if you do not go right to college, what are you going to do with this semester or year you take off?  How are you going to pay for whatever you want to do?  Interested to hear from that side of the coin... "
Should I enter college right after high school if I do not know what I wish to major in?," There is no right or wrong answer to your question. While you may be unsure of what you want to do, if your future plans include college then you can certainly get started upon your graduation from high school. Taking this route would provide you with the opportunity to take the core required courses and to experiment by taking electives in those areas that you are possibly interested in. One route that many students are taking is to enroll in a local college or university to take the core basics and develop an area of focus for the first couple of years and then transferring to a higher profile or ivy league school to study their actual major. Taking this direction save a lot of money and gives you some additional time to think about your major and what you really want to study...best of all your degree will reflect that high profile or ivy league school!    If you decide not to go to school right away that can also be a good choice as long as you make sure you are doing something to advance yourself personally and professionally. Here are some alternatives: - Learn a Trade - Get a Job - Volunteer - Travel - Attend a Vocational School - Join the Military   Good luck! You will be successful no matter which choice you take! "
Should I enter college right after high school if I do not know what I wish to major in?," If you do not know what you want to do, it would be okay to take some time off before college. I went to college right after high school and then left after a year. I eventually went back and completed my degree, but it took some time to figure out what I really wanted to do.    There is no rule saying you must jump right from high school into college. Think about what it is you really want to do in life. Maybe a traditional college will not even be the right path. Maybe it will be film school, culinary school, or a technical school.  "
What is it like being an air traffic controller?," Hi Demarie,   Air traffic control is a career like no other. Once you’ve completed your training, you’ll be part of a community of highly-trained professionals, who are essential to the smooth and safe running of the aviation industry. 24 hours a day, they help to keep some of the busiest airspace in the world moving. The work is challenging and demanding, but it’s immensely rewarding too.   People come to this career from all kinds of backgrounds. So while you may have knowledge or experience of aviation, it’s by no means essential. It’s the kind of job in which your attitude and aptitude is far more important than your specific background.   Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) are also essential to the efficiency of airports and the airline industry. With the ever-increasing volume of traffic, managing flights is a complex and sometimes pressurised job.   As an ATCO, you’ll be using radar and other technology to track planes ‘en route’ between airports and keep in touch with pilots. Alternatively, you’ll be liaising with the planes on approach.   If you’re in charge of the airspace between airports, you’ll be called an Area or Terminal Controller. And if you’re helping pilots land, the role is described as an Approach or Aerodrome Controller.   They issue instructions, advice and information to pilots by radio to keep air traffic flying safely, efficiently and quickly. Broadly, they tell aircraft to go up, go down, turn right, turn left speed up and slow down.    Read more in: http://www.nats.aero/careers/trainee-air-traffic-controllers/   Best! "

For instance, if you want to pursue a management or executive path, than a Sports Management bachelor or master degree would be a good option. Whereas, if your heart is leaning towards being in front of the cameras, talking on the radio, writing news articles or being a field reporter, then Broadcast Journalism is the way to go. However, if you like both areas, a Sport Management degree with a concentration in Sports Multimedia will give you a very powerful base and expose you to a broader spectrum in the industry.

How do you stay focused on studying if your dorm is loud?," Earplugs are an AWESOME investment! :)       Dorms usually have designated study areas, and if that does not work, since you are on a dorm, you must be near the campus.  Most college campuses have a library (or several) with designated study areas, and there might also be a student union with the same resources.  You do not have to study inside of your dorm all of the time, so do not hesitate to go outside with your book under a tree if the weather is nice or to a public library, if you are trying to get away from other students.  You can also ask your student adviser in the dorm or other students where the best, quiet study areas are. "
How do you stay focused on studying if your dorm is loud?, I experienced the loud dorm issue and found that if I wanted to stay in my room then noise canceling headphones with study-friendly music such as classical or jazz helped a lot.&nbsp; Most of the time I would leave the dorm and go to a place that offered a quieter place to study and work.&nbsp; I tried to stay away from the library study rooms because they were usually more crowded and I found that distracting so I would search out quiet spots in buildings or sometimes an empty classroom was available for study use.

That being said, you can master the architecture but it is not focal study in order to pursue an interior design career. Unless you want to become an architect.

All art students have to take the basic art classes before going into more specific class: drawing/painting before fashion design or graphic design. It is the core of what your skills will be based on. I hope that answers your question. Good luck!   Dream big, Vivian "

Computer programmer or software engineer degree,"Well there is not really such a thing as a ""computer programmer"" degree, just computer science.  Most universities will not have degrees in straight software engineering, so companies will hire candidates with computer science degrees.  For what degree to get, look for a school with a good comp sci program.   Now after you graduate, there definitely is a difference between a programming job and an engineering job (not that software engineering is ""real"" engineering, but that is a different discussion).

I am a UI/UX designer but took a few computing courses in graduate school and have worked with a wide variety of engineers while running my startup company. I would say that the best ones to work with were the ones that had a bit of business savvy and creative edge in addition to awesome engineering skills. While pursuing a CS degree, I would urge you to try and seek out at least one UI/UX course to help you stand out. A couple engineers I work with also pursued a minor in Business or Entrepreneurship along with their CS degree. If you are interested in one day starting a company of your own, this can be a great advantage. As a previous answer stated, your main objective should be a continuous thirst for knowledge.

What to take in engineering to become a pilot!??,"Hi Ganapathi!  While a degree in Aeronautical Engineering is awesome, you do not need it to be a commercial pilot.

Psychology is very science based particularly biology. I think its easier to see the differences when you see the courses offered for each of the majors. Sociology is more of the exploration of life (Sociology of Law, Sociology of Gender, Sociology of Race etc.) Psychology courses are more focused on the mind and the science behind how it functions (human development through the lifespan, memory and cognition, abnormal psychology etc.) At the college I work at psychology majors are required to take two science courses with labs whereas sociology majors are not. A lot of the students who major in psychology in the school I work at usually go on to pursue nursing because the pre-reqs for nursing fit very well with the psych major; however, this is not to say that a sociology major could not go into nursing. They could but the science courses would most likely be electives vs a part of the major. If a psychology major and sociology major were both interested in a Masters in Social Work, they can both apply. For a Masters in Psychology for most schools the student would have to have a psychology background but that does not mean they have to be a psychology major. They can have a minor in psychology and be eligible to apply. Psychology programs usually require more research experience.    As far as careers, majors do not dictate what your profession will be. I think it comes down to which one you are more interested in and excel in because ultimately if you want to become lets say a therapist, you can do either one. "

Is human biology a good major for sports medicine?,"Hi Reily,  Human biology would definitely be a strong major if you are looking to go into sports medicine. Most MD programs require that you have pre-med classes in biology, anatomy and chemistry. I would also look into graduate programs you may be interested in and see what the requirements are to apply. Once you have this narrowed down, you can declare your major."
Balancing reality and a dream?,"If you can be an engineer, then be it. Not everyone can be an engineer. The skills required to do your job  will keep you on your toes and alert and make you versatile.  You can be an engineer who communicates all across the board, or an engineer who is brooding and just enjoys the outcome of her thought-process.  Some skills like analytics, maths will keep your mind sharp. And you could still enjoy sports and media, if there ever is presented a ""CHANCE""., by way of education or knowledge."
Balancing reality and a dream?," Andrea,  As you requested, I will not sugar coat any of this.     I like your question.  You have 2 passions and that is a tough decision.  I am not an expert in sports media, but from what I have heard from friends of friends is that it is a tough area to get into.  The first question is what area of sports media are you interested in, announcing, writing, camera man, video production ....  Depending on what you choose, this will focus your education and your ability to get into this area.  For announcers, it usually starts with volunteering at high schools or small colleges and working up to minor league sports or bigger schools.     Engineering or Mechanical Engineering is a tough program in most schools.  It is for the people who are good at math and  physical science, who have focus, and are willing to put in the effort.  Once you have graduated, there are a lot of opportunities.  I have been focused on product development for medical devices and consumer electronics.  There is a shortage of engineers in this country and we can always use more passionate people as yourself to join the ranks.  Overall, I have found the career very rewarding and I love the part that you are always learning and contributing.     You can always choose to do both. There is no reason that you make one a career choice and one a hobby.   Engineer by day and announcer by night or weekend.  Or you find a career path that allow you to  do engineering work in the sports media environment.   "
Balancing reality and a dream?," Hi Andrea, there is no straightforward answer to your questions as Mechanical Engineering and Sports Media are disparate fields in nature.  But one thing for sure is if you like math and science and love problem solving and analytical thinking, engineering is a good field to be in as it can teach you a lot of different skills which can be applied in case you change fields later.  For example, I did an undergrad in Mechanical Engineering and a Masters in Finance, and I currently work at a professional services firm, where my job is a balanced combination of Engineering, Accounting, and Finance concepts.      So here are few options for you:     1) Take up Mechanical engineering as your Major in a college that allows you to either get a minor in Sports Media or atleast take up few courses to see if they really spark your interest that much.     2) As someone suggested, you can still do Mech Engg as your major and either intern or get a full-time job as an engineer at a Sports Media company. May be you will have some access to people doing the Sports Media roles you fancy and then decide for yourself if you want be in that career path     3) Be an engineer by day and sports media person by night       "
Balancing reality and a dream?," I graduated many, many years ago as a MEchanical engineer, I designed Power Plants, refineries as a low pressure hydraulics engineer. Then I worked in aerospace on missle silos using high pressure hydraulics. Then when I wanted a change I moved to software companies running support groups, then I ended up managing Information Technology teams for software development companies.     In short, the degree teaches you to think, and then do what you like and is fun. There are ways of getting to where you want using different vehicles. Just make sure for most days, you get up wanting the challenge of your job. "

How do I build a following on my youtube channel?," One approach I use when I want further exposure is to use other social media channels to further broadcast the content out.

I think at the end of the day, as long as you are doing what you like and you are happy with what you produce, you will see yourself as successful.  Do not get bogged down on the idea you have to have millions of views though. Many social media accounts, not just on YouTube, are actually managed by companies or the people behind them have a staff as well. Also, link your YouTube with a Twitter and/or Instagram page as well. Having multiple social medias for the same account is very popular. Good luck!"

How can I obtain more information about a career in Animation?," The first step is to get to know more about yourself to see if this is really a career which you would want to follow.  Confirming career choice to make sure that it matches with your personality traits is a very important step to take in selecting a career.  During my many years in Human Resources and College Recruiting, I found too many instances where a person skipped this step and ended up in a career area and did not like or feel comfortable with the practical application of that career major choice.  Also, to further confirm that choice and develop personal in-person contacts and networking, it has been proven very important to do networking with those in the field to get inside information.  Selecting a career is like buying a pair of shoes.  They many look great, but you need to try them on and walk in them to make sure that they fit well enough to buy.  The following are some suggestions that many have found to be helpful in locating and succeeding in an appropriate career area. "
How can I obtain more information about a career in Animation?," Since you were not specific in just what you want to do in animation, I will guess you want to be an artist or part of the animation staff.   Networking is a very big part of getting in to animation. You might not get in a glorious position, but in my opinion getting in at any level is great.  If it is something you really want to make a life goal, then learning every aspect of animation is vital.  Join many of the various groups such as LinkedIn, Facebook and others to get to know people. Attending comic cons and animation co s can be helpful as well.  Remember,  have a strong portfolio and a good cover letter that introduces you and your work as well as you goals. Good luck in your future career. "

"As a nurse and midwife (CNM) , approximately how often have lawsuits been taken into action because of malpractice?","This is more an insurance question than a legal question.  You might try finding people who either underwrite malpractice insurance in the field of midwifery or salespeople who sell the insurance.  Or contact a holistic birthing center in a place where you will not be practicing (but maybe in the same state) and find out how they deal with the risks.  Ask these insurance companies what they presently charge to insure a nurse-midwife who has just opened a brand new practice.  Ask what requirements they have besides payment of a premium.  If you are only 16, then it might be premature to worry about such things.  Just research the college and graduate programs that will train you for eventual licensure, and prepare yourself accordingly.  Do not worry about getting sued just yet.  Get the best training, and you will be reducing your risk no matter what.  "
What degree would be more beneficial to me? Construction science or construction management?," Shelby,     I am a civil engineer (10 years experience) but have worked with construction folks in the past when they build my projects.     A construction management job involves more construction plan reading, delegation, scheduling, budgeting, etc - essentially your job is to make sure the job gets done on time and on budget and coordinating the necessary resources to accomplish these goals.     A construction science job deals more with the actual design and construction of projects - you are looking at the finer details of a job.     Regardless of which major you choose, the bulk of your construction career learning will take place on the job through doing actual work and training.  My guess is that these 2 majors have similar classes.  You can always transition to management during your career, if your supervisor thinks you are qualified. "
What degree would be more beneficial to me? Construction science or construction management?, That would depend on your interest. As a construction scientist you would be more then likely involved in research and study of the construction techniques and there benefits or lack of benefits to the process. As construction manager you would be more likely to be involved in the day to day construction activities. I would suggest you take basic introduction classes and see which peaks your interest more. Or try to do a summer internship with the respective companies. As for residential vainglorious industrial construction there are differences in application of knowledge but both use the same basic principles just sometimes on s larger scale.

What made you want to work in the airline industry?," Hello Qunicy, My advice, Do not grow up! Enjoy life and be a kid. All the other answers here were excellent. Get a college degree, regardless of what career you pick. You can not go wrong with education. The more you know, the better equipped you are to make better decisions. ""Knowledge is power"". Remember, sometimes you pick the career, and sometimes the career picks you. I was very lucky, early in my life, a Mig 17 flew over my kindergarten and I was hooked, aviation was for me. I instantly knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. At first I wanted to be a military pilot, but due to unforeseen events, that did not happen.  I was very good working with my hands and enjoyed all mechanical things, so I became a mechanic. Life has been good to me. Aviation is a huge field that has a lot to offer. A job is something you have to do, so you can have the opportunity to enjoy other activities. There are very few people that say ""Thank God its Monday"". That is why your job should be something you enjoy. If you are mechanically inclined, and you like working with your hands taking things apart and fixing them, then maybe you are a mechanic. If you like electrical and computers, then maybe you are an avionics specialist. If you like flight simulators, driving,and operating machinery, you might be a pilot. You need to be honest with yourself and check what your strengths are, and what interests you the most, then you can start to research and pursue a career. Also, try not to be affected by the successes of others. Create your own path and be your own man. Good luck "
What made you want to work in the airline industry?," When I enlisted in the Navy I had a choice of  going into Naval Air or the ""Sea   going"" Navy, (i.e. anything other than an aircraft carrier). I spent 2.5 years in San Diego and 15 months in Guam. You can get your mechanics license airframe and Powerplant  (A&amp;P) with 30 months experience or attend a FAA Certified School. The schools usually run 6 or 8 quarters, based on the number of hours you attend each day. Aviation will prepare you for many other trades. Hydraulics, sheetmetal, airconditioning, engine buildup, electrical, electronics, etc. I also taught at a Community College, where my students were in their Junior year of high school and the school allowed them to attend the Community College. So they attended during their Junior and Senior years (the high school paid for all the expenses) and then 3 quarters later they had their A&amp;P license.  If you did go into the Military.  What you might try is to find a job in ""general aviation,"" (fixed base operators at your local airport) and see if you can get hired to do anything with the aircraft, or just ""shadow"" a couple of different people doing different jobs for a couple of days, etc. Shadow the mechanics, aircraft fuelers, front desk people, etc. "
What made you want to work in the airline industry?," You are not alone! Many people do not know what they want to do even when they are in college.   The industry has many exciting jobs, many very lucrative and you learn valuable skills. Skilled jobs include being a pilot or aircraft mechanic. Important jobs where you learn valuable interpersonal and customer service includes flight attendants and gate agents, if you would like these jobs, I suggest you learn a foreign language to look better in the application process!   Also, there are many jobs in the corporate sector of an airline, including analysts, accountants, IT personnel, etc... it is best to have a college degree for any job you persue, but keep your eyes open and start researching job descriptions now. It helps to have some kind of flexible plan as you go on our career path.    Good luck! I hope to work with you someday! "
What made you want to work in the airline industry?, I would not be worried Qunicy! This is something common. Try to find your strengths and the subjects that you excel at. Concentrate on these subject and research them. I am sure you are going to come across something you would find interesting and build your career around it. Give it time and do not pressure yourself. 
What is there to be expected in the real world?," Hi Adriana,      This is a really good question.  In school you are responsible for your grades and you are largely a professional student. Some students work during college,  but most work part time and not full time jobs. I would say that there definitely is an adjustment period between school and entering the workforce. It may seem obvious, but there are different expectations for work vs school.  Personally, I am expected to perform well, make an impact, and go above and beyond at my workplace. If I want to get promoted, I need to show drive, that I am willing to work, and that I am a team player who works well with others. Being a high performer is what ensure promotion. Slacking off is something that I would do occasionally in school, but it is not something that looks good at work. You are going to have more responsibilities once you graduate and you need to be able to balance these responsibilities and strive to do the best you can at work.      Also, once you are working you are going to have to learn to be financially independent (if you have not already).  Paying bills, scheduling appointments, paying rent, buying groceries are all things you are going to have to do and nobody is going to remind you to do so. You will have to  hold yourself accountable as your parents are not living with you anymore.      While all of this may seem scary, I assure that it is not. Becoming independent and working hard is part of life. Think about this transition similar to the transition from high school to college; at first it may have seemed totally overwhelming and incomprehensible, but it time you learned to adapt and have an enjoyable college experience.        I hope this helps and I wish you the best of luck!!     Best,  Austin  "
how much can i make with my position in the company?," Hi Jesus,&nbsp;&nbsp;Being financially stable is important to me, too !!&nbsp;And how much money you make at a company depends on the type of job that you have in the company, what you contribute to the company,&nbsp;and the responsibilities that you have with the company.     But, to be financially stable, the best advice I can give to you is to “not spend more money than what you make.""     You won’t have any money problems EVER if you just spend less than what you bring home in your paycheck.     Be aware of expenses that suck money out of your wallet like expensive coffee, expensive meals, expensive clothes, expensive cars,&nbsp;expensive hobbies, expensive vacations, etc.     When you start working for a company, you should immediately ""save 15% of your salary."" (Yes, you can do this.... perhaps save even more than 15%.)&nbsp;And, start investing in a 401k savings plan or other retirement plan immediately when you get that first real job. (If you wait, you lose time and you lose a significant amount of money in the long run.)     I am 56 years old.&nbsp;Since 1987, I have been investing 15% of my salary (or more!) every year. In addition, the companies where I have worked for 30 years have contributed an additional 6% of my salary as part&nbsp;of a 401k contribution.     So, for 30+ years, I have been&nbsp;investing a total of&nbsp;21+% of my salary each year.&nbsp;And, yes, I am financially stable.&nbsp;I don’t worry about money.     You will be financially stable if you start saving at a young age. And, you will be financially stable if you do not spend more money than you make. "

What makes DO is and MD is different?," Has anyone answered this for you yet? You can look this up on the internet. I have several friends who are DO’s. They went through just what you are right now. One thing that I learned from one of my friends as she was going through osteopathic medical school, is that it was not easy. My friends that are MD’s never complained of it being too hard. I was a paramedic trained by both medical schools. I must say it’s the osteopaths that I learned the most from. They made me more aggressive and confident. The best thing to do is to call the schools. I had worked with MD,s and DO’s for fourteen years and as far as scope of practice, from what I witnessed, there was no difference. "
Will I be able to truly study what I really want in life or will I have to choose the source in which will provide me more money ?," This is one of those ""open-ended"" questions where the possible answers vary quite a bit.  But with that disclaimer -- YMMV, as they say -- I will give the answer I give my students.  The good news is that yes, you will likely be able to study what you really want in life.  In general, unless you find yourself being interested in something generally considered useless, people simply tend to be really good at things they really like.  There are very, very few human activities that involve nothing of value to anyone.  I tell my students that if they are interested in something, they will likely want to spend time doing it, will get better at it than average, and be able to convince other people to support that activity.  Like giving them a job or money.  And if you are good at something, you will likely make more money at it.  Also, note ""Parkinson is Law"" wherein the needs increase to fill the available resources.  In this case, you will spend what you earn and you will tailor your lifestyle -- usually, ideally -- to meet your income.  The upside to this is that whatever your lifestyle is like, you will be doing something you love.  And that, in my opinion, is the most important thing in life. "

Are you happy with your career?," You cannot have your career chosen for you, of all of the things that can be taught this is not one of them.  Parental influence is inevitable, the most important elements in trying to determine a career path is knowing that you enjoy the subject matter that you will need to study to pursue any given career.  Taking a subject under duress is most likely going to fail, you need to be able to relax with subjects that are enjoyable and that you have a genuine interest in.  Parents and Peers never always have their best intentions in trying to guide you toward what they see as well intentioned and usually well paid careers.  Ultimately it is you that has to live with the choice or spend many more hours, months, years moving to something that you enjoy.  Most of your life is spent working, that is a long time to be unhappy so taking the time to really think about what you enjoy and to pursue a career that you have passion for is critical to you future happiness which in turn drives its own success.  I wish you all the best. "
Are you happy with your career?," Happiness is my choice while the career may not be...    :)  There are always things influencing , may be you influence them, never know.   There is some element of happiness that I can find in anything I did or might have done it.  Perfect happiness is an ideal stage, which may be momentary and sometime not even defined.    So I believe in finding happiness in what I do, than finding the career which makes me happy. My career was never planned and, always guided by living legends around, as a pinball game.    One thing is common for most of us though, the purpose or the living we make out of it, for us and our dependents.  Answer to the question has always made me happy and satisfied, What am I doing it for? If it is not fulfilling it certainly it is not worth it. Answer to the question has always motivated me to be good at whatever I did, is it my best performance or I can be better at it?  I am happy that I did not make those choices , so I had a lot of choices to choose from, and I made the best use of them and still making it. Yes!!   Today the careers are knitted so closely that technology brings people closer and doctors use technologies like 'Geeks""   :)  Reports on ipad !! So do not worry, even if you pick the career of someone else choice , you would landup doing what you wanted to do, as your wish.  Even if you do not like to do something keep it as a challenge or a spice of life, it would never hurt you for sure. It is like a skill learnt well never goes waste,go for it. you will never regret it.    Keep Smiling :) "
Are you happy with your career?," These are awesome questions! Your point about family influence is relatable for me. As a child, I always loved art &amp; design. But there was an overwhelming sense from most adults I met that a passion for art &amp; design would never be sustainable, reasonable, or useful in terms of job success. I continued to pursue this space in spite of that because I simply loved it. Nothing could keep me away from painting, art history, museums, the psychology of art, etc. Of course, I needed to adapt how and what I learned in this space as I grew older. I learned about UX (user experience) and realized that my passion for design could be applied to a career in tech. Now I research user experiences and designs for a living at Google. So I would say: stick to your gut passions, especially when you are young, and balance/bring practicality to those gut passions with research about career outlooks, job roles, job growth in different industries, etc. Good luck! "
Are you happy with your career?," Wow, what great questions. First, I would suggest it is important to keep in mind that careers of today are not the careers of tomorrow. The job that I have today and the field that I am in was only starting to form when I was your age. As times change, so do the jobs and career opportunities. It is important then I think to find what you like and also maybe who you are in core values and align your career path with this. I was actually a political science major and when I went to work in my first non-profit they discovered I was quite competent around machines. (Most of the larger systems were called MIS systems at the time, IT did not really exist as a term). They sent me to my first networking class, database class, and my education grew out of that opportunity. My security passion grew out of my next job where I was working in telecommunications in less-than-stable parts of the world. All new and exciting security challenges in that environment made me think what I really needed to do was find a place where I could work to programmatically solve those challenges and help more people... anyhow, though the career path was less than clear, what was clear was my passion for helping people, which drove the opportunities.  And yes, super happy with what I am doing. What I would suggest is find out what drives you, what do you think are your inner qualities, beliefs, values, purpose - and if you already know them, make a note of skills/aptitude you might have. That will help you align the who you are with what you may want to do, and ideally drive you forward. If you find that you want to become a doctor because you want to help people, you have a passion for the human body, etc. than that would be a good opportunity to align. If you decide however you have beliefs and values driving you elsewhere, there are certainly other avenues to pursue! "
Are you happy with your career?," I am glad that you think a lot on the early age for your own career! You are right the world is change faster adn faster, and the right attitude is to embrace the change and be responsible for your future!   My first advice is that you should really follow your heart, you know or you will know when the time comes, what you really want to do. Take myself as an example, I did not think that much on what I want to do when I was your age, I kinda know I am creative and like doing writing songs or designing things, but on the other hand I feel the uncertainty on earning enough money to support myself and my familily if I choose art related area. Now I am an internal auditor with financial background, and I am happy because I can find things creative on my work, and as long as I earn enough money I can pursue my dream on art anytime!   My second advice is that you should focus more on capability instead of knowledge or skills. knowledge or skills are easier to pick up by people, but also much possible to be replaced by the technology, while capability can not. So really practice all the capbilities including communication skills, logical thinking, creativity etc.   My last advice is that be happy or not is really your own choice, and the key is ""living at the moment"". People under the same situation might have totally different mood, so always stay positive and enjoy the moment of the life!   Hopefully it helps :) "
Are you happy with your career?," As a child, I was always fascinated by technology and primarily video games in the SNES/Genesis era. My immigrant parents always wanted me to join a ""lucrative profession"" like lawyer or doctor, but I found that I was more happy pursuing something that interested me, than investing my life in a direction I found uninteresting.   Luckily my choice to stick in tech has expanded the possibilities in which my career could be pursued. Tech today is so far reaching across industries that it really pays in the long run to get your foundation placed and be able to pick what niche you want to really dive into. Currently I am working in the mobile games industry and I really enjoy delivering fun experiences in quick turnaround. My greatest achievement was developing and shipping a new social feature in one of our games that significantly increased the number of players interacting with each other! It was a great feeling to know that I was really connecting our players with each other add a huge scale!   I am definitely happy with my career choice. I am sure doctors and lawyers make a lot more, but I would rather stay happy enjoying my time ""working"" with a reasonable pay than to end up with a lot of money and less happiness. A little philosophical, but it is choice many of us may have to make. I need to be realistic in sustaining my self and any family, but I do not want to lose all happiness in that. "
Are you happy with your career?," This question is really about your self-esteem, confidence and career aspirations. The answer must be ‘yes’, followed by a brief explanation as to what it is about your career so far that has made you happy. If you have hit a career plateau, or you feel you are moving too slowly, then you must qualify your answer. "
Are you happy with your career?," Think back to when you were a child or in your early teens, what were you passionate about? What did you spend hours and hours on and often forgot the time? What did you truly enjoy doing regardless of other people thought? For me a fulfilling career and life needs both passion and meaning, so I have always adjusted my career path based on that, and have not regretted any of the major decisions that I have made, even if they may not appear to have been the best decision, temporarily. Having family pressure is difficult, but try to make them understand that this is ultimately your life and your choice, and even if you make mistakes they are yours to make.    "
Are you happy with your career?," Hi, That is a fantastic question...I will provide an answer for the career happiness question. I am happy with the company I work for and my job, I consider Dell to be my career regardless of what job I do for them.  Some people may have defined career paths that take them to different companies and organizations within the same career field, I personally have made Dell my career on and off for over 15 years and have done a variety of jobs for Dell, some I enjoy/enjoyed better than others.  I think people find job/career satisfaction from different places and for different reasons.  I am proud to say I work for Dell even on those days when my job frustrates me!  :) Hope this helps...Gary "
Are you happy with your career?," Sounds to me like you have pushy parents who want what they believe to best for you, but from a rather limited view of what is important!    So whilst you should respect and acknowledge the input your parents have, and heed it, there is no need to follow it.    Beware of making a negative choice out of rebellion (i.e. not law/medicine), but instead try lots of different things, and find what is truly you.  And do not be afraid if it is indeed law or medicine to admit that - provided that it is your own choice.  As the other respondents say, it has to come from what motivates you.  "
"I am currently enrolled in Georgia Tech starting this fall, but I am a Global Economics major. Will my major limit my options because I chose to go to a technical school?

"I am currently enrolled in Georgia Tech starting this fall, but I am a Global Economics major. Will my major limit my options because I chose to go to a technical school?

I suspect there are a number that you would be interested in! 
"I am currently enrolled in Georgia Tech starting this fall, but I am a Global Economics major. Will my major limit my options because I chose to go to a technical school?

Do internships help me get into the industry?," Hello Samantha,      Great question! Internships are a great way for you to get your ""foot in the door"". You will not only get valuable experience, but you will get to learn more about the industry and begin networking with individuals already working in the field. The majority of internships are unpaid, but there are internships in which if the company likes your work ethic it is possible for them to offer you a job or they recommend you to another company. Even if the internship does not lead to employment you will gain valuable knowledge, and you will be able to add it to your resume.      My recommendation is for your to do your research on the internship opportunities available. It is best to look for internships just before the start of the semester. I have found that it is a little more difficult to find internships during the semester. I also encourage you to visit your Career Service office at your school. They will be able to aid you in your search for an internship, and they can also provide you with some tips on the application and interview process.      Hope this helps!     Best,   Arianna  "

Can you waive an enrollment fee and who would I contact?," If you type ""fee waiver"" into the search box at the institution you are interested in going to, they are going to have at least one or two pages dedicated to how you can apply for a fee waiver. Generally they are very good about spelling out their requirements and providing an application for you to fill out. The ""Common App"" also has a fee waiver form you fill out. Your school guidance counselor often has to fill out the forms with you and your family, so I would suggest visiting them to talk about this specifically. I am confident they are already going to have a set process/form they use to help students with that. Here is an example of what one might look like: https://www.nacacfairs.org/globalassets/college-fair--homepage/ncf-documents/applicationfeewaiverform.pdf  this will help you think about/start collecting information that those applicaions might ask for.

To know more ask a recruiter, check out your state National Guard website or contact your states National Guard education office. "

How do I become a singer?," I definitely agree with Grace on taking some classes.  I don’t know what your degree is in, but find a PROFESSIONAL vocal coach, or find a certified vocal teacher (could have a degree in music or a certificate in specifically vocals, etc.).  Call the local high school’s choir director and see if that person offers vocal coaching/lessons.  Regardless of what your degree is in, I’d suggest taking additional courses in music theory, music business, and something that includes contract negotiations.  These courses, along with the lessons, will give you the knowledge needed to sign to your full potential and negotiate a beneficial contract.   [P.S. This question was edited by a site admin for grammar and clarity.] #college #music #singer #music-production"
How do I become a singer?,"I suggest that you take some classes to get started. No matter how talented you are, music lessons will allow you to improve your voice and range. If you want to become a professional singer, you can invest in education such as undergraduate programs or graduate degrees."
How do I get psychology research experience?," From your school’s website, go to the web pages  for the psychology department. Then go to the link for “faculty.” Review each of the faculty member’s research interests and studies each faculty member is currently conducting.      For those studies that you find the most interesting, ask the faculty member for an appointment to talk about their research with you because you want to be an assistant!     That is how you should start-by volunteering your time with a psychology faculty member. Then, in a later semester discuss the possibility of doing an ‘independent study’ for a semester or two with that faculty member. Independent studies are generally 3 credit courses, sometimes even 4.      Doing a   independent study OR back-to-back independent studies will provide you with invaluable experiences as an undergraduate student!! "
How do I get psychology research experience?," Hi Amy,  Believe it or not, you are just on time thinking about research.  I hope the following general comment would help you some;  While there are general ways to go about gaining research experience, there are unique routes to research experience specific to each department. I am going to shed light on the former, hoping that will illuminate on some possibilities.   You can write down a list of topics you are interested in doing research on. Start from the subdisciplines first, and then based on your current knowledge of each subdiscipline, write down the topics and areas of your interest. You do not have to come up with an award winning idea at this point in time. I always suggest my students to see where they can find some comfort to their deep personal pain. This helps you out most people persevere and move forward on that specific topic or area. For example, I chose suicide prevention research. It is not uplifting or inspirational for many but got me each little discovery or finding is like a gift from heavens and that keeps me going. There more you go in depth into a you, the more and deeper unique ideas for innovation and discovery you will have. That said, there is nothing wrong with choosing a different area every year or so. That might give one a multidisciplinary outlook, which is another route to creativity. After you have your list in front of you, go look at the faculty profiles of your department and try to match your areas with each faculty at least. Then score each area/faculty entry based on relevance or fit. Then write an introductory really brief email to each faculty and just like your question here, tell them you are seeking research experience seriously and in one or two sentence, tell them you are interested in x topic and wonder if they have any observer/volunteer position in their lab. Try to also meet them even if they say no at first. When you meet them, try to see if they might refer you to their colleagues in other departments, or else, they can give you a bunch of names wherever you might want to be in the next couple of years or so.  After you go over each item on your list with associated faculty members, a lot of things will have happened. In case, you can not get anything at that level, do not lose your heart. There is always a good place for the curious mind. We have all been there at some point in our history. Just remember, if you do not ask, you will not get It. Please let me know how I can be more helpful. If there site allows, you can email me privately or set up a phone call. I would be really glad to help. Good luck! "
How do I get psychology research experience?," Yes, there are multiple ways you can get more experience! Your university should have professors on campus that are currently conducting research. The easiest way to get research experience is to ask to help these professors as an undergraduate research assistant. Here is a great website telling you how to draft an email to ask:     https://ugr.ue.ucsc.edu/email     If you know the professor already through class or other means, you can also just ask them in person rather than through email for a faster response. Usually, professors are more than happy to accept help (particularly if it is a volunteer, unpaid position). If they say they are too busy or are otherwise unable to accept you, ask if they have any graduate assistants or other professors they know of that would be interested in accepting undergraduate research assistants.      There are usually multiple on-campus ways to get research experience, but if not, many research facilities outside of your university will hire part-time research assistants as well.      Lastly, any REU (research experience for undergrads) program is also a great way to get research experience: https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/ "
How hard is the bar exam to become a lawyer ?," Hi Matthew,   The bar exam is pretty challenging.  I, along with everyone else I know who is now practicing law, spent the whole summer after law school studying for it because it covers so many subjects.  Studying and passing the bar is very feasible but you have to study a lot for it so you know how to answer the questions.  I think pretty much every state has a multiple choice examination (the MBE) and an essay portion ( where you have to write multiple short essays).  I know that Texas also has a short answer section as well.  I think the vast majority of states, including New York, have bar exams that last for two days.  Texas, California, and I think Utah have bars that last for 2.5-3 days. Since all the exams last for so long you have to know the correct answers (as best as you can remember) and how to pace yourself so your mind does not get tired during the exam.  Just like any other test you take you will definitely want to take lots of practice exams.  You will also want to invest in other books called supplements to help you grasp legal concepts.     While the bar exam is challenging just know that if you work hard you can definitely pass the bar and become a licensed lawyer in whichever state(s) you wish to practice.  Do not feel overwhelmed and intimidated by all of this.  Just continue to believe in yourself and know that you can pass the bar exam if you decide you want to be a lawyer.     "
How hard is the bar exam to become a lawyer ?," You will need to focus on stress and time management. In order to manage stress you have to manage your time wisely. &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;You have to set a routine for yourself and stick to it for the most part. Once you get into the groove of a routine it will be much easier for you to manage your time and have enough time for everything you need to do (including relaxing). Make yourself to-do lists on a weekly basis, use Google calendar or a planner to keep track of events, deadlines, and due dates. In addition to setting a routine and sticking to it, plan out relaxing activities into your day. Or set aside a time, after everything is done for the day, that you can have ""me"" time. I have also personally found it essential to not only find time for myself but also make use of that time in a way that is best for me and my holistic wellness. I have found the HeadSpace app to be an essential tool in helping me relax and generally feel more relaxed throughout the day, Guided meditation, even if you have a busy schedule, will make you feel more at ease and relaxed throughout the day as a whole (not just when you have the time to relax and focus on that ""me"" time).&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;Set a routine.Use Google Calendar.Set aside Me TimeWrite weekly to-do lists and use a planner.Find a peaceful and restful activity that will help you feel relaxed.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;Here is how to be successful in them:&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;Stay on track - do assignments early, finish things a head of time, and be aware of all of your deadlines&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;do all the the assignments and read all of the coursework required- do not cut corners&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;use Google calendar to keep track of deadlines&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;communicate with your professor early if something comes up&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;do not be afraid to ask for an extension if you need one&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;study, and study a lot! you do not have regular class sessions so you will need to put in more work at home.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=""background-color: transparent;""&gt;Do your best and genuinely try hard to give it your all.&lt;/span&gt;   The best way to score high on the test is to Google search an online program or book that will help you study. Once you find an online lesson plan for success you can use it as a road map for studying. Otherwise, find a book to help you study and spend 45 mins a night reading through it and studying. Depending on when you test is, the first thing you will want to do is organize a studying schedule for yourself. Target studying certain sections of the test and divide them up by the weeks/months you have until you have to take it.    "
How hard is the bar exam to become a lawyer ?," Hi - I agree with the above.  I studied the summer before for my bar exam (California).  No matter how you study, whether indepedent or with an agency like Barbri, you need to have a plan and be a bit structured since there is so much material to cover.     Part of the prep is studying and understanding the material, but I think the mental preparation is almost as important.  It is a lot to take a 2 or 3 day test, so part of the preparation is preparing yourself to get through that.  It can be very stressful just thinking about sitting in a room and taking a test for that long.  People tend to put a lot of pressure on themselves.  The trick is to learn to ignore that kind of thing and just focus on taking the test itself.  It is also to remember (and this is the best advice I got while studying for the bar) that you are not trying to get a perfect score, just pass. "
Curious about Dental Hygiene and Dentistry.," Prerequisites for dental hygiene are not always equivalent to pre-requisites to dental school.  I thought much the way you did when I was beginning college, however I was discouraged from doing dental hygiene as these programs are often competitive and want graduates who plan to stay in the profession of dental hygiene.  In other words, they did not want to accept students into dental hygiene degree programs that did not intend to continue in the profession of dental hygiene.  A BS in dental hygiene will not fulfill requirements for dental school. Pre-requisites for dental school are similar to prerequisites for medical school.  Lots of science, biology, chemistry, anatomy, physiology, physics, microbiology, biochemistry, and often courses that prepare you for dental school entrance exams.  As for the school you choose, dental school is expensive, state schools tend to be more economical and you should look into these options.  Dental school is very competitive and it is important to apply to multiple schools to increase your chances of acceptance.  If you are sure that dental school is the goal, many students begin applying their junior year of college for acceptance after 4 years of college.  I had to work for most of my undergraduate education, but when in dental school, I had little time to hold even a part time job.  Although dental hygiene skills would be valuable in your dental school experience, it may delay your entrance into dental school.  I would advise that you observe both positions to determine which is the best fit for the lifestyle you choose.  Dentistry has many benefits, I have fulfilled both positions, dental hygiene and dentist, I prefer dentist, but it comes with a great deal of responsibility and liability that not everyone is comfortable with at times.  Being a dentist has immense rewards, but the profession has a fitting responsibility that justifies those rewards. "
What did your path to becoming a field sports newscaster/reporter look like?," Hi, Taylor!   How is it going?  As mostly a behind-the-scenes guy (features producer, in addition to - as a hobby - hosting a horse racing podcast), I can tell you that behind-the-scenes, there are many more jobs available than there are on the air.  I am not telling you to abandon an on-air dream, but just that you never know where the path is going to lead so be flexible and willing to try anything.  You might like a different aspect of the business even more as you go along.   I was fortunate to find my media calling in high school, where even in the late 1980s we had a live hookup to our local cable company to do broadcasting.  This was before you could do webcasts using a cell phone (there were no cell phones) and other home-based, inexpensive equipment.    I was fortunate enough to get into the number one school in the country for sports journalism - Syracuse University is Newhouse School of Communications.  The number of sports media figures - both on-air and behind-the-scenes - coming from there is absolutely staggering.  Other good ones (not as good as Newhouse, of course) are Northwestern, Missouri, Ithaca, Boston U, and USC.   I have been at ESPN since 5 months after graduation - almost 24 years (way too long).  I have had a lot of things happen to me, many of which were not good, but to keep your place in the world you have to sacrifice A LOT and be willing to withstand a lot of adversity.  A LOT of adversity.  You do not have enough time to read all of mine.  :)   I currently produce TV features for SportsCenter, etc and - as a hobby - host a horse racing podcast on ESPN.com.  A career in this business can happen for you, too.  Just be flexible, confident but not overconfident, and constantly do things that will hone your craft.   Best regards,   Barry Abrams ESPN "
What did your path to becoming a field sports newscaster/reporter look like?," Taylor,   Every person has a different story for how they got to where they are in broadcasting.  There truly is no one path.   For me, I knew when I was young that I wanted to make my job in sports broadcasting.  I got involved in high school doing play-by-play for my team is games and hosting radio talk shows when I could.  I went to a college with a good broadcasting program.  In addition to journalism course work, got involved with school TV &amp; radio clubs doing as much sports as I could.   After graduation, it took a couple years for me to get my first on-air job.  The first one is always the toughest!  I was the main sports anchor in Casper, Wyoming.  Often times, you have to be willing to start in very small city where the entry level jobs are.  If you are not, you are making a really tough profession that much tougher.  I always tell people who want to be on-air not to say no to basically any job.  You never known when (or if) another offer will come.   I spent 2.5 years in Wyoming, then 2 more years in a small market in Texas before getting a major break and getting a job in Boston.  As long as you truly love the job of being a sports anchor/reporter though, it should not matter where you are.  Sure, you will want to stay ambitious and improve your job, but if you do not fundamentally love the job, it makes it almost impossible to stick with it long term "

What study habits are most important in college?," Hello Rachel,     It is good to be thinking ahead! Here are some of the good study habits that might be useful to you:     (1) Form a study group with your classmates - Having someone to keep you accountable in sticking to your study schedule is always helpful. Your study group might be able to help motivate you, as well as helping you understand difficult concepts/problems you face in your study. You may be able to form new friendships along the way too!     (2) Plan your schedule ahead - The syllabus and exam schedule for each class will be available to you in the beginning of the semester. Definitely take some time to add the exams and homework/assignment due dates into your own calendar! It will help you prioritize the important tasks and stay on track in each class.     (3) Know your school resources - Make sure to check out if your campus provides any useful resources like the library, tutoring center services, career development services and more!     Good luck in your studying endeavors!    "
What study habits are most important in college?," Hello Rachel,  &nbsp; Study habits are a crucial part of your college success.&nbsp; The first thing to remember is to start studying right away versus waiting until the last moment.&nbsp; This will give you enough time to go over the information multiple times and by the third time you will have the information locked in your memory.&nbsp; Also create practice tests on paper and take the tests as they were real.&nbsp; This will definitely help you retain the necessary information needed to be successful.&nbsp; Try reading the information out load versus to yourself.&nbsp; This also helps people retain information.&nbsp; Another good studying technique is to have your friends or family members quiz you on the information.&nbsp; I hope this helps.&nbsp;  "
"After pursuing a degree in the field you want to be, can you go into the armed forces?"," Yes you can.  Many people who join the military already have college degrees.  By having a degree you can join at a higher rank, which means you will have higher pay and generally gain more responsibilities and authority sooner. Also there are often college loan repayment programs; if you have taken out student loans joining the military can be an effective way to start paying them down consistently.   "
"After pursuing a degree in the field you want to be, can you go into the armed forces?"," Cassandra,     It is been several years since I looked into this. At that time, a college graduate could go into the military, either as an enlisted person or an officer. If you go enlisted, you would not get paid as well as if you went as an officer. However, if you go as an officer, there was less of a guarantee of what career field you would go into. I believe they have separate recruiters for officers, so you want to talk to the recruiters for both enlisted and officer programs, to see the difference.     Why not go into the military prior to finishing your schooling, and work on your schooling while in the military? "
"After pursuing a degree in the field you want to be, can you go into the armed forces?"," You can go into the service after going to college. Once you have a degree you would go in as an officer. Most people who go into the military after college have done ROTC in college. I believe being Rotc makes your college much cheaper, but you have to do training in the summers. (I was not Rotc so I am not sure about the specifics). Alternatively, you could go to a service academy (us. Military academy, us naval academy, us air force academy, us merchant marine academy) for free in exchange for a direct commission and requirement to serve so many years on active duty. It was 5 active and 3 reserves when I went, not sure what it is now. But it fluctuates with the needs of the military. My class only have to serve 3 years active duty because of they were lessening the number of people in the Army at that time. Check out the websites of the universities you are most likely to go to, specifically the Rotc program at those schools, and the websites for the military academies for the requirements and specifics. "
"After pursuing a degree in the field you want to be, can you go into the armed forces?"," Normally you can join the military up until the age of 40 or 42. That is because you need to be able to get 20 years before you turn 60, with two wavers you could make 62. Your degree does not matter matter but promotion does come faster with civilian education. If you were going into a specialty job, lawyer, doctor or the like you would have to have your degree.  For specific steps and whither or not you qualify the best bet is to call a recruiter.   "
Is there a difference between High School teachers and professors in college?," In High School only a bachelors degree and a teachers certification is required. If the high school teacher is teaching AP ( advanced placement) , DC ( dual credit) or IB (international bachelorite) they often have masters degree. To become a full time ,tenured professor at a major university you are required to have a Doctorate and often some type of research. Some community colleges and non-tenured professors can be professors with only a masters.       Now in High School teachers often see you very often and know you very well. They help you individually and understand your learning style. University professors often teach to large classes and only lecture. Ofcourse if you are struggling they can help you during their designated office hours.  "
What is a good way to practice stop-motion animation," One of the best ways is to do research in your area to find out companies and organizations that use animation and go talk with them to see how you can help them or at least get their advice on how you can use these skills. Also, consider taking classes at your local community college and doing internships and coop programs in this area. Send thank you notes to all who help you. I will be interested in helping you further if I can. Good Luck!! "
What is a good way to practice stop-motion animation,"Best I can put this, I hope you have tons of patience. Stop motion is very time consuming. Make sure to plan ahead.  Story board your props and environment. a super detailed storyboard. (lighting directions, camera angles and shots, etc.)  From there you are able to to set your shots pretty much.  Best of luck in the Stop Motion world "
How do I develop quality friends in college?," Hi Trevor,     That is a very good question and only with experience you find the answer to this question :)     Friendships have an enormous impact on your well-being and happiness. Good friends relieve stress, provide comfort and joy, prevent loneliness and isolation, and even strengthen your physical fitness.     But close friendships don’t just happen. Many of us struggle to meet people and develop quality connections. Whatever your age or circumstances, though, it is never too late to make new friends, reconnect with old ones, and improve your social life.      Know what to look for in a friend   A friend is someone you trust and share a deep level of understanding and communication. A good friend will:  Show a genuine interest in what is going on in your life, what you have to say, and how you think and feel about things   Accept you for who you are  Listen to you attentively without judging you, telling your how to think or feel, or trying to change the subject  Feel comfortable sharing things about themselves with you  As friendship works both ways, a friend is also someone you feel comfortable supporting and accepting, and someone with whom you share a bond of trust and loyalty.   The most important thing in a friendship is how the relationship makes you feel—not how it looks on superficially, how many things you have in common, or what others think.      Ask yourself:    Do I feel better after spending time with this person?  Am I myself around this person?  Do I feel secure, or do I feel like I have to watch what I say and do?  Is the person supportive and treat me with respect?  Is this a person I can trust?   The bottom line: if the friendship feels good, it is good. But if a person tries to control you, criticizes you, abuses your generosity, or brings unwanted drama or negative influences into your life, it’s time to re-evaluate the friendship. A good friend does not require you to compromise your values, always agree with them, or disregard your own needs.

what are some recomended collages for cosmotology?," Dear Gaby,   While this is far from my field of expertise, I would recommend researching the cosmetic companies of the products you particularly enjoy.

Good luck!    Best, Monica Young "
How much money does a public defender make in New York?," It is admirable you are interested in helping your community.  Upon graduating from law school, I was a law clerk for a Superior Court Judge in New Jersey.   Thereafter, I worked as a public interest lawyer where I represented low-income individuals in family law and immigration law matters.  If you are concerned about your income as a public interest lawyer due to law school loans, it is important to know that many law schools have loan forgiveness programs for their graduates who pursue such a career.   For more information, you can go to a law school is website to find out if it has a loan forgiveness program.  You can also refer to this link which has general information about said programs: http://apps.americanbar.org/legalservices/probono/lawschools/pi_lrap.html   I would also advise you to look into City University of New York School of Law whose motto is ""Law in the Service of Human Needs"".  I attended CUNY School of Law, and it was a great fit for my career goal of public interest law.  One of the main reasons is that it is not as costly as most law schools, especially if you are a New York resident.  Many CUNY School of Law alumni work as public defenders in New York for organizations such as The Legal Aid Society.  "
How much money does a public defender make in New York?," Typically public defenders make less than $100,000/year.

"If I decide to go into an eminent domain law practice, which states would have the most need for that kind of lawyer?"," I do not know much about that area of law but it stands to reason that the states having more population growth and business expansion are those where the government is more likely to exercise eminent domain rights to build more roads, transit systems and other infrastructure construction projects.&nbsp; In addition, eminent domain comes into play in those states having natural resources such as oil, gas and mining operations.&nbsp; I located an interesting website  http://castlecoalition.org/get-information &nbsp; which appears to be a coalition of activists dedicated to fighting eminent domain abuse.&nbsp; There were a number of interesting books offered for sale on their website.&nbsp; You might want to look into some of these books as they some of them would give your more information about where eminent domain activities are more prevalent.&nbsp;  "
"If I decide to go into an eminent domain law practice, which states would have the most need for that kind of lawyer?"," Hi Rachel,     For the most consistent work in building a career in eminent domain, you might want to consider doing it at the federal level. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims (where I clerked) has jurisdiction over all 5th Amendment takings claims. Though sometimes the judges there do travel for cases on occasion, the most consistent work would be  in Washington D.C. But eminent domain itself is not that common of an issue, so you might want to consider learning about related fields like government contracting.    "
How does one decide upon an interest?," I would recommend taking a interest inventory assessment and a skills inventory assessment. If you are still in high school talk to your school counselor and ask them if they have any assessments that they recommend.  My state offers an awesome tool called the career explorer to all of the students in our state. So, your state might have something similar that would be really helpful for you.    If not, this is one of the best assessments I have been able to find online so far. Some of them out there can get a big boring and I find this one to be more interesting. It is a way of learning a little more about yourself. So, try to answer them as honestly as possible when you answer. Answer how you view yourself. Do not answer what somebody else might want you to be interested in. https://apps.madisoncollege.edu/career-assess/    After you take assessments check out the career clusters more and figure out what is going to be the best fit for you https://careertech.org/career-clusters   Once you have a good idea of what career cluster fits you best explore that further. Here is one website that has a lot of information. https://www.mynextmove.org/find/browse?c=62   It is important to keep in mind the outlook of a field when you are considering a career. I would caution you when considering fields that are in a major decline. You can do anything you want...you just have to be willing to work harder than anybody else. Mind you for some of us their are limitations so it is important to consider that. No matter how hard I train and work I am never going to beat Michael Phelps in a swimming competition or Michael Jordan at a slum dunk contest. I can however be the best me possible me. Think about your skills and use them to your advantage when picking a field.  I wish you the best in figure out what is the best fit for you! "

If I simply get an engineering degree will I be ok?

"Hi! What specific things (about college, housing, life, etc.) should we know before to college? What courses are we required to take to be able to major in nursing (to become a registered nurse)? What are your tips for thriving in college?","Hi Paw!  Your passion for giving back to your community is truly admirable!   You are absolutely right when you say that college can be overwhelming, especially for first-generation to college students. However, it is definitely possible to thrive academically on campus while staying calm! My number one piece of advice would be to use all the resources available to you and ask for help. Attend your professor is office hours, use the Writers' Center if you need to, ask older students who have been through the process at your college/university for advice, and find a mentor if possible. Do not be afraid to ask and seek help when you need it! College is not easy, but it becomes a lot easier when you have a team supporting you.  Picking up a hobby or extracurricular activity that you enjoy also helps.   Always remember your passion when things get tough! The passion you have for medicine and giving back to your community will help you get through the tough moments.   Good luck! "
Should I go into the business career or should I follow my dreams.," I was like you. I had a lot of passions growing up, but also had the pressure to get a degree in something that was practical. I think it is ok to want to follow your dreams and have education as a backup plan. Many actors and singers also have degrees. If you eventually want to start a business I recommend a degree in Business Administration. It will teach you all aspects of running a business. Plus, the entertainment industry is a business too. So, it will help you understand how to follow your dream and manage your money.      Good luck! "
Should I go into the business career or should I follow my dreams.," Dear Christina,  this is a standard critical decision for many people. It depends on all the options you have. I would suggest, do not do anything without proper preparation and a plan. On the other hand, do not push yourself into something, where you are totally unhappy.  if you have a job and making money, get yourself enough time to find right strategy plan for your own business. once you are confident you know how to follow the path of your dream job, go for it. Might be hard to go through first steps, however if you doing something with passion and what fulfills you, you will be truly happy at the end of the day. "
Should I go into the business career or should I follow my dreams.," Hi Christina,     You should do both, if you can. Really lucky people can do both at the same time. Less lucky, but still fortunate people can do one, then the other.  If you are very talented, then go for the former, but having a ""plan B,"" is always a great idea. DO NOT BURN BRIDGES, and leave your options open! "
Should I go into the business career or should I follow my dreams.," Christina,  Parents are naturally protective. We can not fault them for that. Though I do believe we all, particularly our younger selves, know what will make us happy.   I want to see you be happy and that will encompass many things, particularly in a career. You say you see your self as an ""idol"". Do you mean trying out for American Idol or is that the measure of success you see for yourself as an entertainer? If it will be your measurement for deciding your level of success as an entertainer, it could be quite the challenge.   Someone who achieves that level of success makes a lot of money, after a while, and seems to have a great life but, they employee and support possibly hundreds of people. Honestly ask your folks, your teachers, your relatives, even people in your neighborhood who own their own business, ""What does it feel like to provide for/support the number of people that you take care of from working for a living?"" Ask them how many family members or employees they have to support. Ask them to be honest with you. Do they stay up nights thinking about how they can do a better job of supporting people? What is the best part of them taking care of the people they employee? What is not so much fun about it?  I know quite a few professional musicians. Most of them truly love their art and their profession. Many of them work for big-time entertainers and one is even married to someone who was once ""very big time"". Still they are happy people, raising families and working hard to support their loved ones.   Your ""later in life"" dream seems to be something interesting to think about in the short term. Every musician/singer/performer starts out playing live. It is not always easy to find someplace to play. If you wish to run a cafe, why would not you have people performing there live while you are open? Bruce Springsteen used to play at a cafe not far from me and it is not any bigger than someone is living room! You do not even need both hands and feet to count the number of tables they have inside. There is nothing that says you can not run a successful cafe and sing there too, and sing other places too. If you get your cafe running right and have someone who can manage things when you can not be there - like your parents ;) - why can not you go out and build a musical career of your own, knowing your business will be there to support you while you are out paying your dues as a performer?  You will have regular revenue coming in. You will always have someplace where you can perform anytime you want. You will have the flexibility to do multiple things. And, you just may be able to help others with the same dream along the way.  There are many, many ways to get where you want to go, and still keep your folks from worrying. Read all you can about the business side of the business. That is VERY IMPORTANT.      This is one of the best books on the subject: Donald Passman is All you need to know about the music business.  &lt;iframe style=""width:120px;height:240px;"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" src=""//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=ja105-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=1501104896&amp;asins=1501104896&amp;linkId=f632cd2795c75843dffd9264d62b1f5d&amp;show_border=false&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=false&amp;price_color=333333&amp;title_color=0066c0&amp;bg_color=ffffff""&gt;    &lt;/iframe&gt;     Good luck to you and feel free to ask all the questions you would like.

Can you continue getting scholarships?," Great question Courtney. I am sorry no one is answered it yet! You can definitely get more than one scholarship! I encourage you to continue applying for them! Particularly different ones, because if anything you most likely can not get the same one multiple times.      I thought I would share a few links to other relevant Q&amp;A on CareerVillage.org that should be super helpful for you to read through in regards to scholarships. I have included tips in the ""next steps"" section below a list of trustworthy sites you should create accounts on if you have not already ( that has good scholarships!) . Here are tips that could help you in your preparation of finding and submitting for scholarships:   Dedicate a minimum of 1 hour a day for a few weeks to applying for scholarships and it will go a long way.  Be thoughtful about your entries, just doing the bare minimum is not going to land you any scholarships. It is better to spend more time on each entry to ensure it is well thought out than to rush through to try to enter a bunch. Quality over quantity!!  I recommend writing one STELLAR essay. Chances are you will use it for every scholarship application (potentially only having to make minor edits dependent on what the prompt is). Tell a story that clearly represents who you are and what is important to you. The goal of the essay should be to let the reader in to your life. If you can do that in a genuine and meaningful way you will be considered, I promise! A couple of ideas: Write about the hardest thing you have had to go through in your life or what makes you so passionate about something. Be sure to include lessons you have learned and what you hope to do with that knowledge/experience later in life.  Spend more time finding scholarships that directly pertain to YOU so it cuts down the competition. Look for scholarships in your local community, or that are just for young women, for example. Know what career path you want to pursue? There are probably dozens of scholarship opportunities that are only for students aspiring to follow a specific career path (e.g. STEM, entertainment, sports, design, etc. etc.)      Relevant Q&amp;A on CareerVillage.org you should read:   What financial support can I find to help me pay for college?    How to stand out when applying for scholarships?    What are the chances of winning scholarships?  "
With a Music Industry degree what are my career options other then working at a record label and how do I break into the industry while still in college?," Hi.  Get specific - what exactly do you want to do within the music industry?  Read up on the various options you have, if you need ideas.  It is always helpful to play an instrument, if you do not already - so you understand musicians and you are educated in that way.  But if you are more interest in the business-only side, then that may not be necessary.  Maybe try to get into radio?  Try your local college station - see if they need any on-air help, or any help at all at the station.  You would be around music all of the time - get a feel for that end of things.  Decide if you are an ""out there"" public person or more behind the scenes.  You do not have to decide today!  You are still young and will find your way.  Do not give up and enjoy all aspects of the industry - learn the ins and outs of it all.  There are scads of books written on the subject.  Start on amazon.com - they sell many books on the music industry.  I wish you well! "
What kind of papers do I need to submit to apply for disability services?," Hi Madison,   Thanks for the question.

what all degrees do you need to be a medical examiner," Often ( but not always) medical examiners are physicians who have complete training in pathology which and often a sub specialty in forensic pathology ( which is the specialty that deals with determine why someone died. The training involves 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, a pathology residency that lasts 4 years and then an additional year of training in forensic pathology. In some places ( small towns etc) the medical examiner may not have this type of rigorous training and may be a doctor who is not a specialist in performing autopsies and determining the cause of death. This would not likely be a full time job in those areas however. The type medical examiner made popular by TV shows and such has the complete trailing I mentioned above. "
How should i get idea for my new ui/ux project!?," Hi Aesha,      Working on a side UI/UX project is great but you do not have to reinvent the wheel. Really examine the products you use on a daily basis and think, ""if I were to make this product, how would I design it?"". You can apply this thought process to any product: digital or physical. Once you have an idea you would like to focus on think about the user journey, hierarchy of information and UI design. Create your own hypothesis about how these changes would improve the user experience and test it with people to give you feedback.      Good luck! "
How should i get idea for my new ui/ux project!?,"Hey Aesha! Great idea!  I think some of the most interesting research projects might be just looking at existing websites you love to use and thinking on what you can improve or make faster. That way, you have a foundation to start on and you do not have to come up with some entirely new. Its also a great way for employment if you want to work at that particular place.  Good luck with your search!"
How should i get idea for my new ui/ux project!?," Hi Aesha!     Find a topic, website, etc you are interested in! As long as there are people involved, there will always be UI/UX issues that can be improved upon. After you have narrowed that down, start talking to users to understand what they like/dislike, sources of frustration, etc. With that rich data, you will have a clear sense as to how the product, service, or website can be improved.     Best of luck and have fun exploring!     JJ "
What parts of working in criminology job are the most challenging?,"Hi Trinity!  I think the most difficult and challenging parts are trying to keep your sense of humanity, and doing what you have to do, even when you do not want to. Examples: Taking a hat away from an arrested person, who is wearing it to cover his bald head, caused by chemotherapy; arresting a guy on the way to his mom is funeral (parole violation). A lot of your co-workers will act ""hardened,"" but most are not really that way - some are.  And nowadays, the prevalence of cameras is a concern. Even if you are doing everything ""right,"" someone can still find a way to use it against you. It is a very challenging profession, and, very rewarding. You just have to find a way to adjust to some of the unique issues you will face!"
What are some jobs in the media industry where I would interact with people a lot?," Hi Ann,   I think there are many, many directions within business you can go given your interest and skill orientation. Since you specifically referenced media as an industry of interest, I will focus my answer on that. Just as another option to think about during your exploratory could be Advertising. As an Account Executive, you would be the central facilitator who works/collaborates with everyone to get the ad done -- highly social, engaged position where you are presenting work to clients,taking initiative,  etc. The media end of advertising is also highly collaborative as it is always working with media companies to negotiate ad costs, etc. On the other end of that, working for a media company (such as a cable network or a sports network like you are referring to, for example) in Ad Sales would enable many of the job traits you are talking about. In this role you work with the advertising companies to sell/negotiate the ad placements.   As part of your research, you may want to go online to specific company websites (for sports media, ESPN for example or any other cable networks like MTV, Discovery, Viacom, etc or general media or advertising agencies like Optimum Media Direction or Young &amp; Rubicam  or even online media platforms like a Netflix) and look up types of positions available, job descriptions and responsibilities to see what types of positions feel like the right fit for you.     Good luck in your exploration!   Stefania "
What are some jobs in the media industry where I would interact with people a lot?," Have you considered Sales?    You could be selling ads, or seats, but either way Sales can get you into almost all those categories mentioned. You could/would give customer presentations, constantly meeting new people and work with sales teams (your group) who would aid you in completing the sales. It is competitive too, which can be a great motivator to do well - whether its for the fame and glory or for the money.  "
Job demand for mechanical engineer with high salary," The job demand for engineers has always been high simply because engineers are problem solvers, and there has never been a shortage of problems.  As far as what the marketplace will pay to solve those problems, that is obviously variable.  But in general, a mechanical engineer will always  command a significant salary.  A side benefit of being an engineer is that they will generally have a talent that is applicable to a wide range of jobs and not have to spend a huge amount on malpractice insurance or facilities and equipment to establish a practice.

Should you go to university or college if you are not sure what to study. It is so expensive.," I would encourage you to take some online career assessments to see if you could identify some potential career paths or clusters. You may want to seek out some assistance from services at an Employment Ontario centre in Toronto where they can give you some assistance on post secondary choices. There are pluses and minuses to both; do your homework. It is a huge investment so you should do what you can to find out what the labour market looks like for people who graduate from programs. Schools are not always the best to give that information. Once you have an idea of what you might want to do, call some employers and ask what type of education they would like to see from a potential candidate.&nbsp;It may seem like a lot of upfront work, but it will save you time and money in the long run than going into something you do not absolutely love! Best of luck! "
Should you go to university or college if you are not sure what to study. It is so expensive.," While it is good practice to have a bit of an idea where you might like to go with your degree, university/college is an opportunity to get outside of your comfort zone and explore many different options. Most people I know changed their mind about what they wanted to do for a career from the time they started their degree to the time that they finished.    In addition, you have so many opportunities available to you while you are in school that you may not have access to otherwise. Try volunteering at different places on campus, go to the campus career centre and learn about opportunities through them, join student clubs or organizations. These are all ways to better determine your interests and if you would really enjoy working in a certain career field rather than just attending classes alone.    University/college can absolutely be expensive, so if you decide to go then make the best of the opportunities available to you while you are attending school.  "
Should you go to university or college if you are not sure what to study. It is so expensive.," If you are not sure, try some courses at your local community college. It is much cheaper and usually transfer to whatever university you eventually end up at (make sure you ask around about transferring credits to another college before signing up).   I have friends that spent a few years at a community college getting their base courses out of the way for a cheaper price before transferring to a more expensive college to finish their degree. This also lets you try a couple of potential majors and figure out what you might like to have a career in. "

Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"I never did until my senior years, I think at first is too much to handle and a bit distractive so concentrate in bringing your grades up and deciding what your choice will be career wuse then about extra curricular activities"
Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"The most important thing you can do in your first year of school is get involved. I would highly recommend checking out all of the different organizations, clubs, groups, and intramurals that exist on your campus! Do not hesitate to look outside of the gates either. Exposing yourself to as many things as possible will do two things: make you a more diverse/multi-faceted/ person and help you figure out what your likes/interests are.   Many companies are not interested in hiring rising sophomores as interns (many companies are as well) but I really do not think this should be your focus at this time of your life. This year should be all about you, it is okay to be selfish sometimes! Whatever you do end up picking to get involved with, stay with it! Companies love to see you sticking with activities or groups throughout your career. Most importantly above all else: Study Hard! I hope this helps :).  #college #internships #internship #freshman #first-year"
Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"Hi Deana,   I think that is a great question and that is excellent to see you already preparing for your college experience.  Here are my 3 pieces of advice for you:  1) College is a lot of fun, but the main purpose is to learn and do well in classes.  Focus on getting adjusted to college life, being away from home, meeting new people, etc.  Everyone adjusts differently and you want to give yourself time to feel comfortable with your classes and university life in general.  2) I strongly suggest joining at least one club or organization your Freshman year and maybe one more each additional year.  This is a great way to meet people and make friends, explore the campus and community, and have unique experiences that many other students will not get (and you can add it to your #resume.  I was involved in many groups in college and met some amazing people that way.  I waited until a few months in to Freshman year before I joined because I wanted to focus on classes and getting adjusted first.  3) If you want to do an internship, I would suggest talking with your #career Services Department, Academic Advisors, and Professors (or members of any student organizations you have joined) and they will be able to provide you with good insight in to opportunities.  I would begin researching Sophomore year and waiting until Junior or even Senior year to do an internship.  I loved college and was very thankful for being involved in many different groups.  Good luck!"
Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"Hi Deana,  This actually a really great question. I am just finishing my college career now, and I think I have some insight here. It all really depends on what you are looking for out of your college experience. I like to divide it in buckets. You can be the college student that focuses on school, and has a stellar GPA and academic record. You can do what I did, and get involved early and quickly, and be somewhat content with a 3.4-3.5 GPA. However, since the main point of college is to grasp a large body of knowledge (both academic and life skills), it is important to define what success means to you. I was over-involved in college, but made up for it because I knew that I did not go out as much as others may have, and could do work on Friday and Saturday evenings. If you already know what industry you are interested in pursuing, hone in on organizations that will help you towards that goal. However, if your passion is different from what you are studying (or you have multiple things you are passionate about), I would find involvements that supplement that as well! During your summers, you should always strive to do something that helps you grow (whether that is study abroad, an internship in Public Administration, or shadowing someone in a social work center).   Here is how I structured my college career, and it seemed to work for me.  FRESHMAN SCHOOL YEAR: Courseload & 3-4 involvements (all in leadership; unrelated to professional dev), FRESHMAN SUMMER: Study Abroad  SOPHOMORE SCHOOL YEAR: Most rigorous courseload & 5-6 involvements (a few professional involvements; lots of leadership) SOPHOMORE SUMMER: Paid internship  JUNIOR SCHOOL YEAR: Courseload & 4-5 involvements (all leadership and in more executive positions) JUNIOR SUMMER: Paid internship  SENIOR SCHOOL YEAR: Courseload & 2-3 involvements (highest leadership involvements in the school) SENIOR SUMMER: Paid internship (hopefully becomes a FT job, as I am graduating at the end of the year!)  Hope this helped a little! Nagela"
Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"Hey Deana! Great question! I am actually from Arlington, TX!  Regarding your question, I actually did both! It is entirely possible to secure an internship while actively doing club activities. Although it is really busy, you should gauge your own limits and determine how much you can bite off. Use your first semester to determine how much workload your classes are to help you gauge how much club activities you can take.  It really just comes down to a healthy balance. Know your own limits. I tend to lean towards professional work because I am involves in business/tech (real experience is best), but in other fields I am not sure.  Good luck!"
Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"You can do both, but be choosy in what you do and be wary of how the time you are committing to each endeavor adds up.   While I was in school I was in two clubs related to my program, but I also worked in the student newspaper, and did a lot of volunteering and internships in the summer or over breaks.   My freshman year I was taking five courses a semester and did too many club things and burned myself out. My sophomore year on, I made a point of managing my time better and including time for me to rest and have a weekend to myself sometimes. The last year or so of school, I did not spend as much time in my clubs and invested most of my time to thesis and internship or freelance opportunities that fit in with my schedule.  Always remember school is the priority and you can generally shuffle your other club commitments around a bit. If they are related to your program, the clubs are generally organized not to overlap with important exam or midterm project dates since they are more aware of everyone is schedules. "
Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"Definitely put grades first. If you have the time to get involved, do not overwhelm yourself by joining four or five clubs. Throughout college, I have been focusing on one organization that means a lot to me, I have held executive board positions, and I am helping to make the organization more known and improve membership. I feel like if you focus on one and you can express how much it means to you and how much you have done, it speaks volumes. Rather than being a part of 5 organizations, where you are a member that may attend one or two meetings.  Good luck!"
Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"Hi Deana,  I encourage you to do both. The umbrella goal is to pursue something that you enjoy, that you like because that will be your weapon as you go through possible obstacles on the way.   During the school year - participate in student organizations (proximity reasons, they are on campus). During the summer, you should definitely be interning. You should apply before the Summer as most internships have deadlines in the Spring semesters. Interning at companies will help you secure a job after you compete your degree. Employers generally look at internship experiences that you have had.  Hope this helps."
Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"If you want to meet people, join one club but your primary focus should be to get settled into your new environment and make sure you get started on the right foot with your courses.   Before leaving college you should get involved in professional organizations in your field of study because in some cases they will help you network and get you hired.  Best of luck.  "
Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"Focus on your grades. You are paying for the classes, training and experience. If you feel bored after your freshman year, then consider joining a club."
Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"Especially in your freshman year, it is all about balance.  While extracurricular activities are important, it is also very important to establish your academic foundation - GPA for example.  A poor start in the first two semesters can take the remainder of your undergraduate career to recover."
Clubs vs Internships Freshman year of college,"While it is great to get involved I would not advise it right off the bat. Focus on your studies and feeling your way around campus. Once you feel settled and use to things, you can start thinking about clubs and organizations. I would leave internships for junior and senior year as you get closer to finishing. That will give you time to think about what areas you really would like to explore career wise and tailor your choices into those fields. "
How do I get a job as a psychologist in law enforcement?,"Learn philosophy and psychology, learn about people by being around them, the more you understand human behaviors the better you will be at predicting them. get your BS in psychology,  a minor in criminology helps. volunteer or work as a police officer. Schools are competitive so you’ll have to get Mostly  A’s and B’s.  Apply to universities that have police psychologists as professors and a program you like.  In grad school, get involved through research or networking. Read in advance, go to conferences and think about what you want to write your dissertation on-tailor all of your assignments on that subject so it will be easier later:   Apply to an internship that offers the specialties you like. Graduate, postdoc, study for the EPPP and get licensed."
"Once I have a degree, will my employers care what my degree is in?"," Hi Anna,      It depends on your career path. There are some occupations that require a particular degree while others have  arecommended' degrees. Either way, experience is very important. If you do not have a degree in the subject manner make sure you get enough real world experience to talk about during interviews.      Good luck! "
What are som possible careers behind the scenes in professional sports that I can explore?," The NBA, NFL and every other professional sports organization and its teams all operate like any other company, meaning there are several types of jobs/careers you could pursue (PR, marketing, HR, accounting, operations, administration, etc.). When you get to college, make sure to be ask active in your athletics department as possible. Volunteer in a department if you have the time, or if you are busy playing your sport, talk to your coaches and sports information director so they know being in athletics is a career path you have chosen. Ask for their help in making connections so you can gain experience in the area you are interested in. Working in sports is a highly competitive field. Making connections and gaining experience will be key to getting ahead of the other candidates. "
What are som possible careers behind the scenes in professional sports that I can explore?," Sports are a product and just like any other business they need support. So that answer is, you can do almost anything from Finance, HR, Technology, PR, etc.  Focus on what drives your interest in sports. Is it the stories of great games and athletes?  Then consider writing or media production as a career.  Is it the numbers behind the games? Load up on the statistics classes and become a researcher who supports the writers and media producers.  From medicine to marketing, you can pick a career and steer it toward the sports world.  Focus locally with local sports stations or teams to gain some experience and get to know everyone you see in those workplaces.  From there you can pick what you like and dislike and steer your course accordingly. "
What is Mechanical Engineering in the private sector like?," It depends on the company you work for, and I agree, if a company is treating you well and offering you ways to improve and develop, stick with them.  A lot of life is realizing the good in what you have and not being fooled by false ideas about what a (another) company is or does.   If you work for a larger company you will have the opportunity to become an expert in one area.   If you work for a smaller company you will need to be proficient in many areas and will have opportunities to do so.   If you work for yourself or start your own business, you will need a bit of both and having a good business plan and contacts is a must.   In mechanical engineering you have the opportunity to spend as much or as little time at a desk as your role will allow.  I have spent weeks at my desk every day some times late into the night trying to finish a design, I have spent time at professional races working in a pit as a mechanic, I have operated test machines and made parts on various shop tools.  If you are most interested in a particular role, figure out what skills you need to perform that role and go out and get them, do not be ignorant of the other skills, but if you are great at what you do and are willing to move, you should have no problem finding a job or making your own.   Good Luck!   Sincerely, Blake Jenssen "
What is Mechanical Engineering in the private sector like?," I can not speak for all mechanical engineers, but my job working in product development is quite diverse.  I does include design and simulation work (desk work), working in a shop to assemble products, and product testing.  I do all mechanical related work on my company is products so it is multidisciplinary in the sense that I perform designer, drafter, technician, mechanical engineer, and project management roles, but not multidisciplinary in the sense that I do not do electrical engineering or software engineering work.  I hope that makes sense.   When you work for a company, you will be asked to sign an agreement saying that any intellectual property you develop becomes the property of the company.  If a patent is awarded for your work, your name will be put on the patent as the inventor, but you will not own the patent, the company will.  So you have to be OK with this.  Otherwise your options for employment will be very limited.   I would say you should stay with a company as long as the company treats you right and you are happy working there.  In that type of situation there is really no need to change jobs.  I would say you should definitely start your own business if your life situation allows you to.  As far as I know, the only disadvantage to starting your own business would be giving up your current job.  There is risk associated with starting a business.  Honestly, if I had a good job at a company where I enjoyed working, I would probably deem it to be too risky to start my own business and I would not do it, unless it was a business I could run part-time like in the evening or on weekends.  I hope this helps. "
What is Mechanical Engineering in the private sector like?," Sam gave some great advice.  I would like to add to this.     I also have been in product development my entire career.  With product development, there is a need to work with your factory and your suppliers.  I have had a lot of travel both domestically and internationally to work closely with the factories that assembly my products and the factories that make the components that are used in my products.     The fascinating part of design is that there is always something new.  New technologies to make your parts and new applications for existing technology.  It is an environment that is always challenging.      Not only do we get to work with other disciplines in design and manufacturing, we also work with industrial design, marketing, accounting, sales, etc. Products we develop are the what the customers interact with and provide the image of the company in style, feature sets, and quality.     I find it never boring and always challenging. "
What is Mechanical Engineering in the private sector like?," It depends on what company and in what area you find employment.  How well you like the work depends on your personality.  I had a number of jobs where I did not know what I would be working on during the day.  I worked for a shipyard that did repair and maintenance work.  Every day was different.  The job was fairly high pressure, but I thrived on this type work (work well under pressure).  Another job involved inspecting equipment to ensure that it met GE is expectations and specifications - did a lot of travel, and not a lot of desk work. "
When is the best time to apply for internships in computer science or economics?,"I will only speak to the CS side b/c that is my background, but I imagine the same would be true for econ majors, or any major for that matter.   To echo Candace:   You can get an internship virtually anytime, but typically college students get internships after their sophomore or junior years. Personally, I was fortunate to land an internship as a software engineer after my freshman year, which really gave me a great perspective of what SWEs do at a very early stage in my collegiate career. So, I would say it is never too early (within reason). As long as you have some skills that you can bring to the table, you can and should apply for an internship.   If you go to a career fair or apply for an internship and they tell you it is too soon, do not worry, just stay in touch with that person and apply again next year. And you should ask what type of skills they are looking for so that you can make sure you obtain those skills for when you apply next year.  But to answer you question directly, it is really never too early to look for and apply for internships, you just need to make sure to do your research on the company and you have some of the skills they would need so that you can be successful in the internship. Hope that helps answer your questions.  #college @internships #summer-jobs #summer-internship "
When is the best time to apply for internships in computer science or economics?,"Hi Nicholas,  Summer internship application season actually begins in autumn of the year prior, around the time universities hold their fall career fairs. It runs all the way up to late May. I would say look at the company where you want to intern and reach out. My daugher is a Chemical Engineering major and she actually got an internship while she was in high school.  She received a scholarship as a result."
What are the frequently asked questions about JEE Advanced 2018?,
What do those who major in computer science do?," Most computer science graduates become software engineers. Your experience as a software engineer will be different based on which area of CS you decide to focus on. In internet companies web technologies are very important as as an engineer you will be more concerned with efficiency, simplicity of design and iterative building. If you decide to join a systems company you will probably be more concerned about memory management, robustness of code, portability. CS graduates also become product managers where they get to define the vision of a product and their role spans across tech and business. Data sciences is another popular track especially if you are interested in algorithms.  "
What do those who major in computer science do?," Hey! You could do a lot with a computer science major. It opens the door for you to go into product management, application development, web development, user experience design, or just being a software engineer either in building really cool things in infrastructure, search analytics, site reliability, or data mining. If you like having a vision of building an overall big picture product, then product management is a really cool opportunity. If you like thinking about how to build something that scales theres a ton of different specialties within computer science that will have tons of opportunities. CS classes really emphasize a way of thinking, problem-solving, and teach a very analytical perspective. "
What do those who major in computer science do?," You have asked for valid question. Based on my experience, Computer Science degree will give wider scope which includes internal (basic hardware) and also software programmings. In addition to that you might chose your interest ares such as Machine learning &amp; programming, data algorithms and etc. Basically these students gets recruited in companies and get involved mostly in few specific areas. Offecource, creativity plays major role in here. There are new set of requirement came up recently in Computer industry and I hope very few university teaches about this coerces, something like Data Mining, Algorithms in social networking,  User predictive analytics, automated QA and Mobile development tools. In simpler words you learn theory in your graduation and practicing in your career to make social impressions.  "
What do those who major in computer science do?," The field is very broad and the coursework involved with a computer science degree can vary from school to school. From a theory perspective, computer science is close to mathematics. You will learn how to solve problems in as an efficient way as possible using math to help prove it. Using those theoretical aspects, it would then be possible to apply them to more practical use cases (e.g. how mapping software find the fastest route from point A to B).   There are other courses that may focus more on software engineering or practical portions which teach about different programming languages and how to write code. These may involve concepts that pertain more to code organization and being able collaborate with others. They will teach you different programming paradigms (ways to structure code to solve a problem) and how the language breaks it down into machine language (what goes on behind the scenes when you write a line of code). "
What do those who major in computer science do?,"      Hi Willis! I took computer science courses in college,  and I now work in technology (programming is part of my job). Learning about how computers work is a really awesome experience. Frankly, CPUs are amazing! It is real physics, performing useful actions, in a tiny tiny package. If you major in CS, you will study how computers work, and then you will spend time programming computers to complete tasks. There are a lot of ways you can take it: you can learn about networking, about machine learning, advanced image processing, robotics, and more! If you are really serious about getting an idea of what the coursework is like, why do not you take a course in your spare time! You can sign up for an intro to Computer Science course on  Coursera  or  EdX  for free!  (These are great resume boosters, by the way)     "
What do those who major in computer science do?," There are many different areas that computer science majors can go into.  You get into many of them based on the things you study at school and on your own time as well as the projects you do.  As a personal example, my friend entered college as a computer engineer, but in his second year he decided to go into game design.  He sort of switched into computer science and started taking more design and algorithm courses and he started to work on his own game.  Now he works as a game developer.   In the end it is your own effort and interests that bring to you the areas that you are interested in.  However there are many areas to go into and try out, so there is always the option of switching and trying something new out. "
What do those who major in computer science do?," Computer science is exciting and the field is wide: you can learn more about how to create great software, or learn how the hardware works, or advance the field theoretically through mathematics-based study, and much more.   There is a difference between computer science and learning a computer language, or studying a piece of electronics.  Computer science requires you to, for instance, learn the math behind why arrays sort the way they do, or what is the most efficient way to write to a computer is memory.  Learning a language is a high-level way of using a computer that lets you build applications but is a lot less theoretical (at least at first).  Studying electronics can be hands-on, finding ways to make physical objects perform computational tasks.   Try out a computer science course online, of course, but my best advice is to think about what you enjoy most: hands-on building things like robots or fixing old computers, or making websites, or knowing why calculus has important applications, or something else.  That will lead you to the relevant part of computer science coursework. "
What do those who major in computer science do?," Hi, I started out with studying Computer Science as a course that was offered at my high school. Then I moved on to graduate from Computer Engineering, and have close relations with friends that studied Computer Science as well. With this type of background, you can get internships and jobs at many technology companies, writing code and developing programs for different current and upcoming technologies.   A typical class in computer science involves learning by working first-hand on code. Usually the instructor will start you off with sample code pieces, show you an example, and have you recreate it yourself and expand on it. Programming is best learned by actually writing the code yourself and testing out different cases. A lot of logic is involved with programming as well, so an interest in mathematics would help with your understanding in the classes. "
What do those who major in computer science do?," There are many different options, it just comes down to what you like doing. Some options are: Developer System Administrator Network Engineer Site Reliability Engineer Database Administrator Web Developer Mobile Developer   Basically you just need to try many different things and then choose what you are passionate about. "
What do those who major in computer science do?, Here are the list of opportunities available in this field are:     Developer  System Administrator  Network Engineer  Site Reliability Engineer  Database Administrator  Web Developer  Mobile Developer  UI/UX Designer  Graphic Designer  Backend Developer  Frontend Developer     There is ample of opportunities available in this field provided whats your area of interest.       
whats a good way to start of an argumentative essay?, I would start by stating your position in a compelling way that grabs attention. You will need to follow your assertion with data supporting your position&nbsp;and present the opposing argument to your position with arguments against the opposition. Always check your grammar and spelling.  
What challenges women face everyday working as an architect?," Hello Keira, Unfortunately there are males out there amongst us that feel women are not as qualified. I can say I am not one of them. I served in the Army and seen women out preform men everyday. I also have a strong  opinionated wife with two little girls 11 &amp;2 who I hope do not face that type of oppression. If they do I know my wife and I have taught them not to give in to them but be bigger. I’ve been watching this question for a week hopeful that a female architect could answer your question.     I am very impressed about how aware you are of social issues in the work place but I feel you shouldn’t worry about that as a primary challenge in architecture. Architecture is a design field where many female architects have been successful like Zaha Hadid. Research her and other female Architects for an  inspiration. I suggest focusing on you and your goal of being an architect. Draw and design something constantly.  Don’t let they naysayers rent space in your head.   I hope I gave you some encouraging information. Good luck in your future endeavors!          "
What are the best ways to prepare for the sat?," Hi Alexandria,     Taking the SATs is a stressful endeavor; however, there are many ways to prepare for the test.  The methods will vary by each individual, so try a few different methods and see what works best for you.      There are many courses offered by a third party that help prepare students for the SAT. The courses could be in person classes or online.  I recommend looking into these classes, researching what each class has to offer, what are the areas of focus, when the class is offered, the length of the course, and cost.  If you know a specific area that needs the most important, check out Khan Academy online. They have hundreds of thousands of videos on a variety of subjects that you can choose and tailor your studying.      The other option is purchase SAT preparation books. Once again, there are many companies that make/offer these books, and the books will sometime overlap with the in-person courses. I recommend researching these books to see if they will benefit your study style. The books will generally cost less than the classes.     After you find the method of study that works best for you, I recommend taking practices tests. There is no better way to implement and reinforce what you have studied by taking practice tests under real testing conditions (using the same time constraints). After reach practice test, go back and study areas that you missed questions in. The SAT is a tough test, but with strong study habits, you will do great!     Best wishes,  Amit "
What are the best ways to prepare for the sat?," First ask, ""Do I know the strategies to optimize my score?"" There are test-taking strategies, which will improve your performance. Example: Avoid spending too much time on a question that you can not answer quickly, move forward to the next! There are books and guidance out there about such tactics, you may want to scan through one or two for ideas.     Another consideration is test preparation. You can do this on your own, by brushing up on math problems, reading and writing, or you can pay for a service to help. Test prep on its own will not make you ""smarter"", but it will help you face the more challenging questions with better poise and confidence. There are on-line services, too; see https://www.chegg.com/test-prep. There are likely local services available in your community as well.    "
Can someone who starts out as a Mechanical Engineer advance to become a CEO and would they still be able to practice engineering?, If you believe then it will definitely happen. What is the idea on your company??? Do you have a plan?  
"As competition increases nowadays, how can one keep his or her core values such as integrity protected?"," Great question Juan. I can understand that this can make one feel frustrated at times.  But you need to keep this in mind - Integrity mean doing the right thing at all times and in all circumstances, whether or not anyone is watching. Your aim is not to worry about the incorrect stuff the other people do, but to worry about what you are going to do.  What is more important to you? You doing the right thing and having a clear conscience or worry about what others?  You will come across unethical people in all walks of life to get ahead but there is only so far a person can go. At the end of the day, you are answerable to yourself. You will know deep down whether you are doing the right thing or not. Mind you, this is not called ""talent"" as you have mentioned. Why do you say that "" those of us who truly study and stay true to ourselves will continue to be affected by those who fail to follow the moral laws"". You do not have to be affected by this. Instead continue to do the right thing, lead by example, hold your head up high because you are doing the right thing. Stand up for what you believe in.  I too have come across such people in my college/career journey and would feel disappointed. My dad then would tell me that you should not measure your success, failure against others. Do not perceive life as a competition with others. Compare it with your previous achievements, or against the person you wish to be!  How will your core values help you? You will feel more satisfied, happier, and more fulfilled in life. Tomorrow when you assume a role of the leaders, these values become extremely important. ""Think of it (core values) as a tree: values are our roots that keep us grounded in what’s important to us. The strength of the values determines the strength of the trunk, branches, leaves and fruit from year to year. A strong tree supports the ecosystem around it; a leader with strong values supports the organizational culture""    Juan, I would like you to read these two article that will give you more clarity and will motivate you to keep doing the right thing!  Success Will Come and Go, But Integrity Is Forever  This is one article that I hold very dear to me and I re-read every 6 months! It summarizes what my dad has taught me!   How to Live With Purpose, Identify Your Values and Improve Your Leadership  Try and relate this to your context. (Work/Organization/Company = School/College. Manager/Leader= Teacher/Professor)   Good luck! May the force be with you! :) "
"As competition increases nowadays, how can one keep his or her core values such as integrity protected?", Hi Juan!   You asked a very important quesiton.  It is important to have a set of values and stick to them.  Here are some sites that will help with that: http://www.evancarmichael.com/library/dr-philip-a-foster/Setting-Your-Moral-Compass-to-North-Why-talking-about-ethics-is-not-enough.html http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roya-r-rad-ma-psyd/finding-your-moral-compass_b_1009290.html http://goodlifezen.com/5-crucial-reasons-to-carry-a-moral-compass/ 
When is going to community college first not a good idea?," Hi Alexander,  I would say that community college is almost always a great choice. I began my studies at my local community college, which allowed me to live at home with my parents, and work a full time job. This allowed me to save money, and of course my costs per credit at college were significantly cheaper as well. After two years, I moved on to a university, and all of my credits successfully transferred over. Community college is a very cost effective way to get a degree as well as network with individuals that can help grow you further in the future. Good luck on your journey!  "
When is going to community college first not a good idea?," I do not know if I understand the question correctly. I assume you mean to go to community college for 2 years and then transfer to a 4-year college to finish your undergrad degree.   It depends on your major, your grades, whether and what grad school you want to go after undergrad degree. While it is hard to generalize, unless your goal is to go to very specific grad schools, it is OK to do the first 2 years of your undergrad in a community college. Hope I understood what you were trying to ask and helped with the answer. Good luck!  "
When is going to community college first not a good idea?," A community college is always a great option, is local, it is way cheaper and you always have the option to transfer to a university.  If you have the option to go to a university with a full scholarship by all means take advantage of it.  "
When is going to community college first not a good idea?, A community college is a great way to start. After I finished 6 years in the military I got my associates degree at a local community college. Then transferred to a four year college. Was the best decision I made.  
How useful are Physician Assistance?," You might also consider becoming a nurse practitioner, both PA and NP professions are great paths to take. Look at the area you would like to live in and see which profession is more employable in that area. In general as either a PA or NP you will be employable. Good luck! "
How useful are Physician Assistance?,"     Take a look at this link -- hopefully it will take away all of your horrors! Becoming a PA is a great career path to choose right now, and here is proof!  http://www.onetonline.org/help/bright/29-1071.00     You are going to be a great someday! Good luck :)   "
How useful are Physician Assistance?," Actually demand for PAs is pretty high right now and expected to continue to increase. It is hard for anyone to tell you with certainty what will happen in 7 or 8 years when you graduate, but if the market changes you can always find something else in healthcare. This assumes that you get the appropriate master is degree and internship experiences, of course.  "
How can you know if it is the right decision to take a gap year before college?,"If you are torn between a gap year and starting college, you may want to consider starting college, but planning to study abroad your sophomore year. This would allow you to start college, but you would still be planning towards an experience in the ballpark of the gap year. You can even do multiple countries during the same year.  During my sophomore year of college, I did the fall semester in France and the spring semester in Spain. I took two months in between semesters and traveled to 11 different countries in Europe. I do not regret going my sophomore year rather than my junior year. A couple of items to note that may influence your decision: 1. Some colleges require that you have a certain number of credits completed before you can study abroad. Most of the time, these credits equal the amount you would typically have as a junior. If you are transferring in dual-enrollment credits, you are ahead of the game. (That is actually how I was able to study abroad my sophomore year.) Again, this does vary by university, so it is definitely something you will want to check out. 2. Do you have the financial means to support yourself during your gap year if you choose that route? Are you going to get a job or do you just want to travel? If you just want to travel, it can get very pricey, even if you set yourself a hard budget. The advantage of doing study abroad while you are in school is that all of your government aid (loans, grants, etc) is not affected, which means that you can actually use your same loans to pay for an apartment, buy food, etc. Depending on where you end up studying abroad and how well you budget, you could end up with money that you can put towards your next semester instead of having to spend it all on one costly semester in the United States. This depends heavily on the program, but it is definitely something to consider.  Study Abroad programs are available for almost any major and they are always an asset on your résumé. Many of them are flexible. If your goal is to travel as much as possible, look into a ""Semester at Sea"" program or something similar. These programs allow you to travel to multiple countries while still completing coursework. Like I mentioned before, there are so many options, so if you feel like you are ready to start college, you may want to start, but start looking into study abroad programs as soon as possible so that your adventure will be waiting for you!"
How can you know if it is the right decision to take a gap year before college?," First you would need to determine the why behind the need for a gap and if it is necessary.  If it is because you just want to take a break, travel, etc, that may be a distraction.  If it is personal family reasons, financial, etc then you can figure up a plan to stay on track.  Taking a year break can turn into 20 before you know it.  It happened to me.  Eventually I went back and now have my MBA, but it was a struggle to balance work, family, and all that comes with that.  My recommendation would be to get it started and completed as soon as possible if college is really what you want to pursue.  Enjoy those college years while young.  Best of luck!! "
How can you know if it is the right decision to take a gap year before college?,"What specifically have you considered doing during your gap year? What country or countries would you want to spend time in? Do you have the financial means to do this? It is much easier to make a decision when you are looking at specifics (such as X program in Y country, which costs $Z, vs. moving to X city to start as a freshman at Y college). "

how hard is the pre vet/biology major?," Congratulations on being interested in becoming a vet. It takes a special person to enter this field and meet the demands which this career area presents.&nbsp;The first step is to get to know yourself to see if you share the personality traits which make vets successful.&nbsp;The next step is doing networking to meet and talk to and possibly shadow vets to see if this is something that you really want to do, as a career area could look much different on the inside than it looks from the outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Getting to know yourself and how your personality traits relate to people involved in various career opportunities is very important in your decision making process. During my many years in Human Resources and College Recruiting, I ran across too many students who had skipped this very important step and ended up in a job situation which for which they were not well suited. Selecting a career area is like buying a pair of shoes. First you have to be properly fitted for the correct size, and then you need to try on and walk in the various shoe options to determine which is fits the best and is most comfortable for you to wear.

Is it hard for an introvert to become a well respected lawyer?," It may be challenging, but certainly not impossible.&nbsp; One of my dearest friends in law school was very introverted.&nbsp; She was so sweet, very quiet.&nbsp; She is an excellent corporate lawyer.&nbsp; Frequently people have an image of lawyers&nbsp;as aggressive or particularly outgoing.&nbsp; People have different personalities and there are different lawyers.&nbsp; Most extroverts who go to law school enjoy being litigators or practicing law inside the courtroom.&nbsp; There is so much you can do with a law degree.&nbsp; There is appellate work, where you would primarily be researching and writing briefs; corporate&nbsp;or transactional work; real estate law.&nbsp; There is something else for you to consider.&nbsp; Just because you are introverted in one area of your life does not mean you can not be an effective advocate.&nbsp; I remember my first time in law school when I had to give an oral argument in front of the class.&nbsp; I was so nervous that I just froze, and I mean I had nothing to say.&nbsp; Fast forward and now I just love the sound of my voice.&nbsp; I can argue a case anywhere.&nbsp; In my case I just needed more practice and confidence.&nbsp; In my friend is case, she had no desire to see a courtroom, she just enjoyed the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom line is,&nbsp;there is room in the legal field for introverts and extroverts.&nbsp; Best wishes&nbsp; "
Creative Writing Day In the Life," Hi Gregory,   I love to write and I think that is the first prerequisite for an author.  I have heard it said that writers do not always want to write, but they feel compelled to write.  It is great that you have started writing books!  I have found that it is easier to begin small.  For example, I had never written fiction so I took the Gotham is NYC Writers Workshop online and there we were tasked with writing several short stories.  Short stories are a great way to break through because you can send them to any number of publications.  A published writer has much more credibility than non-published.  Poetry is another very good way to get published or get into the field.  Finally, blogging has made writing a very competitive field but it has also leveled the playing field for unknowns who are talented writer.  Anyone can start a blog.   You should have your work critiqued by other writers or a teacher, and ask them to be honest with you and suggest ways of improvement.     I hope this helps and best of luck in your future endeavors! "
Creative Writing Day In the Life," Gregory B.,   I actually graduated with a BS in Civil Engineering. This strikes some folks as odd, however, the creativity of designing and building a structure adapts itself quite well to creative writing. About four years ago, I decided to follow my heart and begin writing creatively. To be honest, my first contracts were extremely low-paying and through various online freelance writing sites. Once my portfolio was built (about three-months), however, I established a client base that has allowed me to practice the art of writing while earning a fair wage.    While this may not be the types of creative writing you seek, I enjoy research and meeting people, so it suits my personality perfectly. On the other hand, I have had the opportunity to ghost write several books, help students from college to medical school and doctoral studies to law school with personal statements, academic papers, etc. Some of my favorite clients are the ones who have improved to the point that they no longer need my help.    What I am trying to tell you is that every person, every writer, has a different definition of and methods for expressing their creativity. While writing a novel is my dream, I also recognize the need to earn money....which has at the moment sidetracked me to an arena of writing for which I never expected, yet love. Good luck on your journey, and take advantage of this wonderful online world that offers endless opportunities for earning money until your first novel is published. "
Creative Writing Day In the Life," There are a lot of different types of jobs you can get if you work hard as a writer. If you are working as a journalist, you recieve topics from an editor, or you offer stories to an editor about a topic you are interested in, you would then do your research, interview your subjects, write, edit and submit your story for print.    However, as a novelist life can be different. Raul Dahl the author of ""The BFG"" ""Matilda"" and other children is classics had a rule:  Be at your desk from 10am-12pm and from 4pm-6pm. Even if you do not write, you have to be in the seat. The reason for this, I believe, is it is important to treat writing like a job. You have to be ready to write, even if you do not have any ideas inside that moment.    Whatever field you decide to pursue, you can always remember the harder you work, the luckier you will get.  "
Should I start asking about internships after or before college?," You should start asking about internships as soon as possible, possibly even in high school.     Here is an interesting internship story I would like to share:     Internship Story     During my daughter is senior year in high school, the highlight of the year (and of the whole high school experience) was to be a several month long internship program. Everyone signed up and indicated the type of internship that they wanted - all except for one girl. This girl wanted to become a doctor and wanted her internship to be with the local EMS unit at the local fire station. So, she talked to the head of the EMS unit and got his approval and made arrangements with the school to create her own internship. Of all of the students about which I heard, she was the one who benefited the most by her internships. My daughter is was definitely not the highlight of her school career. Her first choice fell through and her final assignment was not really what she wanted and did not give her the type of exposure that she had hoped for.&nbsp;     This shows that you can create your own internship! Locate a company that fits the parameters of the type of experience and exposure that you are seeking and work with them and the appropriate people in your school to put it in motion. After all, if there is an internship program existing today, anywhere, it had to be created by someone.

You can go about this two ways. First, if you have firms or companies you are highly interested in, check out their Career section on their website. Often, internships are listed under Jobs or email them your interests. Second, as soon as you get in, I would visit your university Career Services center -- they will be your key resource and have built some wonderful partnerships and connections with companies where you can interview to intern. good luck!

Which forensic science related job would be best for me based on my interests?," Forensic science graduates are highly employable, both in the specialist arena of forensic investigation and in other associated areas requiring an enquiring, scientific and legal mind    Job options   Jobs directly related to your degree include: •Analytical chemist •Biomedical scientist •Forensic scientist •Scientific laboratory technician •Teaching laboratory technician •Toxicologist   Jobs where your degree would be useful include: •Further education teacher •Higher education lecturer •Police officer •Science writer •Secondary school teacher •Solicitor •Solicitor, Scotland   Remember that many employers accept applications from graduates with any degree subject, so do not restrict your thinking to the jobs listed here.    Related case studies   Shelina   Forensic facial mapping expert    Work experience   It is essential that you gain some laboratory work experience, in order to prove you have the necessary skills, such as attention to detail and accuracy. Work experience is more likely to be found in a scientific or hospital laboratory than a forensic setting due to the sensitive nature of the work. Working for the police is another good option, for example, as a special constable, as this will provide you with a valuable insight into police work and the role of forensics.   Those graduates seeking to extend their laboratory experience may find internships from smaller employers that are initially voluntary but may lead to paid employment.   Search for placements and find out more about work experience and internships.   Advertisement   Typical employers   The government outsources most of its forensic work, so job opportunities mainly arise in private companies.   Other major employers of forensic science graduates include police support departments and the Ministry of Defence (MoD), particularly the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory. Opportunities can often be found by exploring the strong links between academic departments and employers, so check with your university for potential contacts.   Find information on employers in science and pharmaceuticals, law enforcement and security and other job sectors.   Skills for your CV   Studying forensic science develops skills specific to laboratory work including: •attention to detail; •analytical and interpretative skills; •a methodical approach; •patience and concentration, as laboratory work can be routine and detailed.   Some skills are transferable, such as: •team work and working independently; •presentation skills, as you need to be an effective verbal and written communicator, e.g. court reports.   There are personal qualities that may be useful, such as a resilient outlook, as some work is upsetting or unpleasant. You could be asked to work unsocial hours, so a flexible approach is helpful.   Further study   Typical postgraduate study includes Masters in forensic science, molecular biology or fire investigation. Doctorate research could include drug, perfume or DNA analysis, or terrorism.   A relevant Masters degree or PhD can significantly improve your employment prospects as competition intensifies for jobs. However, it is worth considering that courses can be difficult to fund and demand a higher level of academic ability.

I live two hours away from university; is it better if I get on-campus housing?,"If money is not too much of an issue (and even if money is a bit of an issue), I recommend living on campus.

I was only 15 miles from the University of Southern California, and I commuted.  I do not have too many regrets in life.  But, I truly regret not living on or near campus for college.

Do you enjoy being a broadcast journalist?,"Hi, Hailey!  Thanks so much for reaching out.  That question, which at first seems overly simplistic, is actually a much more complex question than it seems.  There are three main issues here:  1.   The internet has made it more difficult for true journalists to get jobs.  It is not so simple to take what had been print publications (newspapers/magazines) and simply transpose it online.  The reason is that the advertising is not there to support it.  There are so many choices on the internet that it is easy to say, I do not NEED the heft of the Sunday New York Times.  I will go to Yahoo is news or even Facebook is news feed, etc.  Thus, a lot of potentially good reporting will eventually fall by the wayside.     So-called ""citizen journalists,"" those with blogs that they could (if they wanted) create from the couches in their mothers' basements, have drawn followings that have reached or even surpassed those of trained journalists.  The law of averages says that some of those blogs are not bad, either.  I think it is harder for the average consumer to tell the difference, which cheapens the hard-earned sheepskin I got from Syracuse University is Newhouse School of Communications.     You would think that the ability to communicate in this day and age would expand the opportunity for us in media.  In some ways, it has, but in terms of jobs, you would be surprised - media is consolidating, not expanding.  2.  Because jobs are consolidating and going away, more people trained to report and produce, as I have, are moving into public relations jobs.  There are plenty of those to go around, by the bushel.  Every prominent (and even not-so-prominent) individual/company needs to put ""spin"" on various situations and also promote everything they are doing.      There is certainly a place for that kind of job, and I have dealt with media relations people for teams, etc who have been wonderful facilitators for us.  Media relations means that you coordinate all the reporters who cover a team, let is say - when they can come, who/when/where they will interview someone with the organization, information they need, etc.  Without those people, we could not do our jobs.  So, I am definitely not trying to disparage what public/media relations people do.    That said, PR folks are obviously there to spin the overall ""message"" of their employer for the better (or, in some cases, to smooth over the damage control).  My brain, however, is hard-wired to report facts and tell honest, fair, balanced, and accurate stories regardless of who winds up looking good or bad.  That is who I am, not just what I do, so journalism is where I ended up.      3.  Donald Trump has given all of us in the media business a bad name.  I do not think I need to go much deeper into that.   However, it would make sense if impressionable young people like you, Hailey, hear the daily bilge that comes from that man is mouth and decide that journalists are, at best, grimy people and at worst, evil people.     We are not evil people.  We can get grimy, depending upon the story we are reporting.  :)  Our job includes (but is not limited to) holding people accountable for their actions.  That can be a difficult task that is not for everyone.  If that kind of thing is hardwired (or could be) into your brain, then this is the business for you.    To see what people REALLY think of journalists, try to find the YouTube clip of the show, ""Last Week Tonight with John Oliver"" where he talks about the mining industry.   The show reported horrendous dealings by this one mine executive, who sent the show a ""Cease and Desist"" letter to stop their reporting on the story.  Oliver replied something like, ""We never got one of those letters before, but you know what we are going to do?  Rip it up and keep going!""  The crowd goes crazy. That is what we do.  I hope that answers your question, Hailey.  I think telling stories, whether at the kitchen table with your grandparents or on TV with the nation, is the richest, most rewarding exercise in the world.  I have had issues with my employer over the years, as everyone does, blah blah blah.  However, I can see no other profession, in general, in which I would rather be.  Best of luck to you, Hailey!

There are few tracks to pursue auto mechanic, like lube and tire places, independent shop and dealership. I will suggest you to focus on dealer or independent shop. I prefer dealer for its professional way of treating female in the field. Look for education that lead you to a specific auto make and get your foot in the door of dealership world.

"I am in my 50’s; went back to college after realizing I Love interior design. Is agism a problem in this field, what jobs would be open for an older graduate?"," Cynthia,  Yes, ageism is a problem in every field. However, sometimes people are too quick to shout ageism when there are many other possible factors: top of the list is lack of the requisite computer skills. Do everything you can to get GOOD at the various software used in the trade. Do your best to look physically capable of doing the job. (I hesitate in saying this , as I have disabilities. However, if you will be out in the field taking measurements, carrying sample materials, etc., you need to be able to get around. )      Also, start right away to create a portfolio of your work. Play with LinkedIn and learn how to create an electronic portfolio. Create a website. You need to be competitive, and that means being visible. Especially in California! Remove stuff from your resume that reflects how old you are. Do not list HS graduation dates, old work history, etc. I do not know what ""goes"" in as far as resumes are concerned, but given it is an artistic endeavor, I think I would be at least a little creative with the resume. Visit a peer in the trade, or the school career office, for pointers!     As for schooling, see what is available through MOOCs. (Google it!) There is a lot of free content out there.      The Payscale and Indeed websites mentioned previously are good sites. Check them out. Networking is important, especially when trying to land that first big job. If possible, go to trade shows. Look for others on LinkedIn to connect with.  Somebody will give you that first big break, but you have to work to get it!     Best,  Kim "
"I am in my 50’s; went back to college after realizing I Love interior design. Is agism a problem in this field, what jobs would be open for an older graduate?"," Hey Cynthia! I love that you want to continue your education, that is great! I will be very honest with you. Yes, it will be more challenging as an older student, but DON'T let that deter you! My mother went back to college in her 50s and completed her bachelor is degree. She worked in the field of advertising / copy writing for most of her adult life. She was not necessarily trying to further her career or change fields. Rather, it was for her own personal satisfaction. After raising kids as a single mom, it was a goal of hers. She achieved it, and I think that is pretty awesome.

The fact that you worked in flooring is a huge bonus. A couple of questions...1) When was the last time you dusted off your resume? I would think about that -- what are your goals and objectives? and 2) Are you realistic about how long it will take for you to reach your educational goals?

Does the age of the college or university make a difference to employers?," Yes and no.  Mostly no.  The age of the school is not nearly as important as its reputation, or more particularly the reputation of the particular degree program at that school.  That said, schools that suck do not last all that long, and the longer lasting ones like Harvard and Yale tend to have good reputations.  So while age is related to reputation, and thus to how an employer views you, the reputation is the more important piece and there are newer schools/programs with great reputations as well. "
Does the age of the college or university make a difference to employers?," I think how much your choice of university matters depends a lot on which field or industry you are going in to.  Some care a lot, some almost not at all.  As Ryan said, though, the most important part is the social connections you make through your university and what fields and jobs they will connect you with.  If you go to a school where a lot of people pursuing the same interest as you are also going to, chances are you will find more connections to jobs in that field. "
Does the age of the college or university make a difference to employers?," I am going to echo what Pran said and say focus on the reputation of the school/program. The name of the school and the reputation of the school/program are much more important to employers. There are some employers who will only recruit at certain schools, not because they are elitists, but rathe because they have a limited amount of money and resources to dedicate and want to get the best bang for their buck.   And I say school or program, because in some specific circles, even if a school does not have top rankings overall, it might have an extremely well-regarded program within it that is top in it is field. This can be very useful if you already know what you want to go into after college.   Additionally, the school that you go to will have an alumni network that will be happy to help you in your quest to start your career. If you find a school that is renowned for a program that you are interested in, you are much more likely to find alumni in positions that can help you get a jump start on your chosen career. For example if you are going to a famous art school, knowing that there are numerous alumni who are artists who have been successful that can help make connections, is a valuable asset. Compare that to going to another school that is famous for producing great politicians, means that your pool of alumni there that can help you will be slimmer. "
Is it a good idea to major in Biology for pre-med??," Many people who are trying to do pre-med do end up majoring in Biology because it is very closely aligned with required pre-med courses. It will provide you with good fundamentals for medical school, and since many others are also on a pre-med track you will have many classmates in the same boat as you. However, keep in mind that since many others will be in the same boat as you, you will need to find ways to make yourself stand out over the other Biology majors during the Medical school admissions process (I.e. Extracurriculars, leadership/internship experience). You really need to consider how much you love Biology, and whether there is a different major you would be more interested in before making a decision! "
Is research needed in college," Hi Kennedy  - Most undergraduate programs do not include research courses. There are exceptions of course. There may be courses where you will learn about research - what it is, the different ways in which it is conducted, the research process, etc. But you will probably not have to actually conduct any research of your own - meaning you will not  go out and collect data and analyze that data. You will write papers where you will use sources and argue a specific point. But that is writing - and not really ""research"".  Course catalogs - many of which are online - can be viewed to see what courses you will take in a specific degree plan and an overview of what the course is about. They do not show the specifics like a course syllabus does, but you can get a general idea about most of your courses that way.  If you want to go to medical school, you will probably want to look at getting your undergraduate degree in biology or chemistry  - or one of the sciences. So you will learn about the research process in those courses. Some students WANT to be involved in research so many colleges have Undergraduate Offices of Research opportunities that help students find research experiences. Many medical school admissions offices look favorably on students who have research experience.  The article below discusses the benefits students can get from being involved in research. Best of luck to you! "

You may explore coaching centers in Bangaluru  as well e.g. Rau is, Bharat Coaching etc. So, visit a nearest IAS Coaching center, ask their modules/models of training and cost,  accordingly you decide."

What type of monetary need would suffice in college?," Hello Benjamin,  there is no specific amount you need to actually carry to college (enough cash or credit cards to pay for daily expenses), but you should have enough financial sources to pay for college expenses.   You should consider always Tuition (cost to attend the school),  Room and Board (rent, dorms, utilities, food), School Expenses (books, lab fees, ...), and Personal Expenses (car, gas, clothes, shoes, entertainment).     Total cost per year for my 4 children each ran approx $25k to $30k for a California State University in-state regardless if they lived in the dorms or on their own.  Note: 2 of them are still in college.     According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2017–2018 school year was&nbsp; $34,740 &nbsp;at private colleges,&nbsp; $9,970 &nbsp;for state residents at public colleges, and&nbsp; $25,620 &nbsp;for out-of-state residents attending public universities.

What majors do you need to work for the cdc?," So if you are interested in working for the CDC, I will assume that you are interested in various areas of public health.  There are several ways you can go about this:   1) Major in biology, become a PhD-bearing biologist, go join the CDC as a researcher.  Your best bet would be to focus on a disease area which is of interest to the CDC.  The most obvious are infectious diseases, such as influenza and HIV, but they also care about obesity, cancer, and other non-infectious diseases.     2) Major in biology, but pick up some math as well.  Epidemiology (the study of how diseases develop and spread) is of huge interest to the CDC.  (I have yet to find a field where knowing extra math is unhelpful.)     3) Become a doctor (bio major recommended) and join the CDC.  I am a little less clear on what the path is here, but a specialty in one of the CDC is top diseases, or public policy is a way to go.     4) Major in biology and public policy.  This one I really do not know anything about, but have known people to start out their lives as biologists, and move into the domain of public health, the challenges of keeping a population healthy.     Hope this helps!   "
What internships are available for high school students on the path to becoming a veterinarian?," Hi A.D.,   There are plenty of opportunities available to get you started on the path to becoming a vet.  A good place to begin would be your local animal shelter/rescue.  Shelters are always in need of volunteers and you will learn all about  the proper way to care for and interact with animals.     If you have a local emergency animal hospital, you may be able to volunteer there as well.  You can also contact local vet offices to see if they need help - you may even be able to earn a little money! Please be aware that you will most likely be cleaning a lot of cages to begin with, but you will be in an environment that both interests and challenges you, all the while gaining valuable experience to help you make your decision.   Good luck! "
What internships are available for high school students on the path to becoming a veterinarian?," That is great that you are thinking ahead.   When I was in high school I did 2 internships. One a vet clinic and the other at a private zoo. I did one at the vet clinic because it gave me exposure to the clinic setting and taught me clinic procedures and such. I did the one at the zoo so that I could get exposure to exotic animals since vet clinics only have cats and dogs coming through, for the most part.       I would definitely recommend doing a vet clinic internship/volunteer during high school so that you can make sure it is really what you want to do before you spend 8-9 years in college and go $350,000 in debt.      After interning in a vet clinic, I decided it was not for me. I found it boring treating cats and dogs all day and having to put a lot of them down and dealing with crying owners and such. I liked the zoo internship better because I got to work with so many different animals and train them and build their enclosures, give them medical treatment, handraise babies, etc.      I would suggest interning/volunteering at a small vet clinic to get exposure to the daily routine of shots, checkups, dental cleanings, etc. Then if you like that, I would progress to an internship at VCA Animal Hospital because they get more injuries which require surgery and such (more interesting).  You can do these during the school year, after school.       After the vet clinic/hospital, I would check into a zoo volunteer program. Most zoos require that you be in college to do an internship with them but most of them have volunteer positions for high school students during the summer. Happy Hollow Park &amp; Zoo has a Zooteen volunteer program that you can do from May - August or Sept - April but any volunteer/internship positions at a zoo are very competitive so having first volunteered at a vet clinic will make your application look better for the zoo.

How do I decide what to major in?," *please excuse any spelling or grammatical errors*     Hi Zachary,   First, great question! It’s terrific you love learning about a variety of things!     Second, while I have been working 11+ yrs (as a career advisor to college students and hiring college students for internships and grads for their first jobs) I have met so many students unsure about what to major in and unsure if their major choice was “right”. So, you’re not alone in thinking it’s hard to decide!      Here’s how the students I have met decided on their majors. I hope sharing how they did it will be helpful to you:          ""I Want to Be A...""    I have met students who knew what they wanted to be since before they arrived at college. You have probably met them too! They are the students that say, ""I want to be a _____."" And what they say they want to be, is also their major. So for example, ""I want to be an Accountant"" or ""I want to be a Nurse"". Simple, right? :) Their major is based on their future career—like Accounting or in Nursing--and their major provides them with the education, skills and knowledge they need to start their career.       ""I Want to Work in...""     Other students I have met are interested in working in a certain Career Area, such as Business or Information Technology. The Career Area they are interested in working in then becomes their major. They may not know exactly what they want to do in Business (like whether they want to work in Finance, Human Resources or Sales for example) but do want a career in Business. Choosing a Career Area as a major gives students the knowledge and skills in this area so they can start their careers after college. You can find out about all the different Career Fields (also called Occupational Groups) here  https://www.bls.gov/ooh/        “I am Really Good at..."" or ""What I Love Doing is...""     I have also met students who are really good at a certain skill or love doing one thing, and want to learn more about it while in college. These students majored in things like Graphic Design, Spanish, Creative Writing, Math, Dance, Animation, Film—just to give a few examples. As graduates, students found careers as their majors (such as a Graphic Designer, Writer, Animator, etc) or sometimes their major led to another career altogether. For example, a Math major I knew was hired as a Computer Programmer and a student who graduated with a degree in Film was hired as a web designer. After graduating, students can use the skills and knowledge gained to start careers in their majors or in different careers that need the skills and knowledge students gained in their majors.       “What Really Interests Me Is...""     Finally, some students major in a subject area they are very interested in. There are no limits to the areas of interest that students could major in, but some of them include majors like Anthropology, Asian Studies, History, Law, Philosophy, Political Science &amp; Government, Urban Studies, and Women’s Studies. After graduating, students can start careers in their major area, or their major can be gateway to other opportunities in different careers and fields like education, government, legal, and social services, just to name a few.

"I am not sure which career path is be best for me, can someone help guide me in the right direction?"," It sounds as if you have already done much to help you determine what you want to do. In the work you are doing now, you also might want to add physical therapy or occupational therapist to your list!  You are already narrowing what you want to do by ruling out what you KNOW you DON'T want to do. Many of the things you state you are interested in have a very similar path such as via Nursing School. You will need at least a BSN to progress in these areas. Perhaps you can do some internships in your areas of interest after you have your degree, or minimally, you can get permission to shadow in those areas. To work in those areas, you must be prepared to maintain ongoing certification aand recertification in ACLS, ATLS in some areas. Depending on ages, you may also have to remain current in PALS or NALS. But, the path to most of those areas is via Nursing school. So, you will want to start there, if you know for sure you are not wanting to consider PT or OT. Good luck in your journey.  "
"I am not sure which career path is be best for me, can someone help guide me in the right direction?"," Nelson, I agree with the other posts but I get the impression from you question that you want advice on becoming a firefighter even though  you are  invested in becoming a Nurse.  I know several firefighters who work other jobs on their days off and I know nurses who work other jobs on their days off. I happen to be one of them.  I am a Nuclear Medicine Technologist and a Nurse and I enjoy both of them.  I became a Nurse at mid life because it was something I always wanted to do, I wanted to work in a certain specialty, which I do and I have plenty of options for work.          Consider once you become a nurse, you will likely be able to work shifts that fit with training to be a firefighter. I encourage you to investigate your interest and I believe you will be surprised that the uniqueness of the two careers will open many opportunities for you. Good luck! "
"I am not sure which career path is be best for me, can someone help guide me in the right direction?"," Like Deb said, it is good that you know what you DO NOT want. Although we all have to pay our dues, doing the work that you do now &amp; being able to continue to work for the same hospital after passing the NCLEX would be of great advantage to you. See if your hospital has an externship program so that could add as experience when you apply or a position. You may not get your dream job initially, but it looks like you are determined &amp; hard-working. Good luck!! "

How do I get more looks on my job applications?," Hi, something that might help is to make sure you list any achievements you have acquire either through out school or at any job regardless of the type of work you have done in the past. This has given me results in the past because if&nbsp;I have anything that can set me apart from the competition, I am going to make sure they know through my resume and even adding a cover letter. &nbsp;Remember to show on your application what you can bring to the table and also make sure to set your self aside from all the other applicants, just remember never sell your self short but do not make promises you can deliver.

"I love engineering, math, and drafting.  Having trouble deciding which type of engineer I want to be.  Should I take gen ed courses in my freshman year?"," First, I am assuming you are enrolling to study engineering.  If so, most colleges will have a recommended sequence of courses for you to follow, and it is important that you follow it if you want to graduate in 4 years, as each engineering major will have its own specified coursework once you hit your junior and senior years.  Some education requirements will be required, and it is likely that you will have one or two your first several semesters.  If you are not enrolled to study engineering, then you will want to make sure you are taking the appropriate math and science courses expected of a first semester engineering student.     As for deciding what type of engineer to be,  you typically do not declare your engineering major until after your third semester. Many colleges offer some sort of introductory engineering courses to help you decide.  But if you have taken physics, think about what you studied and which areas you liked best: mechanics is mechanical engineering; statics is civil/structural engineering; and electricity/magnetism is electrical engineering.  There are many other types of engineering, but they find their roots in one of the branches of physics.       Another idea is to read thru the course offerings and mark which ones seem most interesting....you may find that your school has a really great program in an engineering discipline you have not considered.  Look at the engineering clubs and groups and what their activities are, and what majors their members have.     As you enjoy drafting, I would look at mechanical or structural as a starting point.      "
"I love engineering, math, and drafting.  Having trouble deciding which type of engineer I want to be.  Should I take gen ed courses in my freshman year?"," In my undergraduate years, I saw that similar classes existed in both the engineering and liberal arts colleges, and that for the purpose of credit hours, were often interchangeable.  But you would want to verify that at your particular college.  As for taking gen ed classes, I would say most definitely yes, given that you have the time and funds necessary.  If anything has helped me in solving problems and coming up with inventions, it is the fact that I took a lot of general courses in many areas prior to completing my engineering degree.  You never know what will come in handy.  One of my first patents was the mechanism for reconfiguring faulty packet switching networks, and I got that idea from having studied how the plasticity of the human brain allows it to recover from a stroke.  Might never have seen that coming, had I not stumbled into that area, I think.  Another patent had to do with verifying switching networks that popped out of thinking about how multiple patterns exist in a musical composition that make it sound so rich.  It is always easier to solve problems when you apply a known pattern to a seemingly unrelated system.  The Russian system of invention called TRIZ is based on that same idea, which I now know.  But at the time, it just seemed like the easiest and most fun way of looking at problems.  I am always reminded of the Yogi Berra quote, ""You can observe a lot by watching.""   "
"I love engineering, math, and drafting.  Having trouble deciding which type of engineer I want to be.  Should I take gen ed courses in my freshman year?"," Hi Brett,  No, I would not recommend that you take general courses your first year.  There are many variations of ""Engineering""  but they are basically off shoots of the basic types of engineering: Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Chemical.  It has been my experience that the first year courses in all of these are very similar.   Do a little research on the Internet and talk to engineers that are ""in the field""  as to the type of work each of them do and then enroll in the type of engineering which seems most appealing to you.   It is very important that you select a branch of engineering that is appealing to you because engineering is not easy and yo will do much better working in an area that you find interesting.  A very broad, basic classification of the engineering types is as follows: Mechanical Engineers work on things that move (i.e. airplanes, automobiles, machinery, etc.), Civil Engineers work on things that do not move (i.e. buildings, bridges, roads, structures, etc.), electrical engineers work on things having to do with electricity (i.e. computers, electrical distribution systems, motors,  controls, etc.).  You get the idea.   Once you are in school, you will have the opportunity to talk with students and professors in all of the various types of engineering.  If you decide that your initial pick was not what you really want to do, you can transfer to one of the others at the end of your first year without ""loosing"" many or any credits for the classes you have already taken.   When I started out in engineering, I initially signed up for Civil Engineering, but after discussions with a few professors, changed my major to Mechanical Engineering and have been very happy with Mechanical Engineering working mostly with large power generating equipment .     Hope this helps,  Doug.   "
"Hi, I am in 9th grade right, now, and I would like to go into the field of robotic medicine. What should I do as a high school freshman to prepeare for the career?"," Omkar,   I would highly suggest to reach outside your current network of your robotics coach or other teachers at your school. Seek out professionals active in the robotics/biomedical fields within your area. Generally they will be impressed by a student in high school being confident enough to reach out and ask them for advice on career paths and what has inspired them to their achievements. They may even have their own connections regarding scholarships or internships. Shadowing a professional even just for a day can also be enlightening.   Additionally, begin searching for scholarships and robotics competitions. Often competitions may have scholarships attached to them such as the one found here: (http://www.roboticseducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robomatter_Scholarship.pdf). Also, if you want to stand out I would suggest doing your own research on current issues in the industry and trying to come up with your own solutions.   Best of luck! "

For actual use of the robots you will have to pursue a medical degree, so chemistry, biology should be your focus. "
How do you choose the life insurance policy?," 1.Get multiple insurance quotes that include all options or restrictions so you know exactly what is available. 2.Stay away from any agent or organization that cannot or will not fully explain exactly what you are buying and why. 3.Always remember that you are the client. At no point should you feel bullied or intimidated into buying something that you aren’t sure of.   4.Though you certainly want to purchase adequate coverage, don’t over buy. If your premiums are too high to manage because of the extras that have somehow found their way into your policy, you will be much more apt to allow it to lapse. 5.Once you find a company or agent that you are comfortable with, ask questions. The clearer you are on what type of life insurance rates and options are right for you, the easier it will be to agree on a package that suits your requirements. 6.Consider life insurance for the whole family, not just the adults. Expenses that follow a death or serious illness or accident will add more stress to an already devastated family. 7.Remember to regularly check your policy for changes that may affect you or your family. Almost all companies will send out notices to explain changes that they have made so make sure you review them. 8.Review your policies relevance regularly and update as your family and their needs change. 9.Consider your life insurance a fixed and non-negotiable expense in the same way you would your mortgage or car payment. It’s easy to consider life insurance as a luxury rather than a need, when in reality that is definitely not the case. 10.Don’t be overwhelmed by “what if” or worst case scenarios. "

How important is it to have a MSN in the nursing field?," Morgan,     The level of education you decide to complete will largely be determined by what you intend to do within the nursing profession and what you would like to do with your degree.     With a Bachelor is degree, this is considered the minimum level required for ""professional"" nursing practice (as recommended by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing). Typically this degree can lead to middle management positions or educator positions  in addition to general nursing positions.      A Master is degree can lead to higher/upper management positions, more advanced educator positions, or towards advanced practice nursing positions such as a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or as a clinical nurse leader. There are some general nurses who elect to obtain a MSN for their own personal goals or reasons, but otherwise it would not be necessary for general nursing positions.

What should I do if my parents cannot help with College Tuition?," Hi Braelyn,   The price of a college education can be pricy. Fortunately there are many resources out there that you can look into to help with financing. First of all, i would recommend that you speak with your guidance counselor. They should have access to information and materials on financial aid. If your counselor is unavailable, contact the financial aid department at your intended university of study. They will be able to point you in the right direction.   Keep in mind that the Federal Government provides Pell Grants and loans for low income students. There are also many scholarships out there for people of certain backgrounds, ethnicities, educational interests, etc.   https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/finding-scholarships   Many schools also offer work study programs and counseling to help you work for your education. Working over the summers to save up money may also be an option.   The GI Bill may be another option that you might consider. While it does involve putting your education off until later while you serve in the military, it may end up paying for the majority of your tuition.    http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/get_started.asp   I hope that this information is helpful. I wish you luck in pursuing your education. "
"After getting a MBA, how do you choose a career that fits both your qualifications and your personal interests?","Sonia, the advice Ashley provides above is excellent.  I just have some additional thoughts I would like you to consider.  You are currently in High School which is where a lot of your future interests may find their seeds.  Take advantage of this time to explore what you are passionate about.  You have opportunity to explore the arts, science, math, athletics, history as well as writing and literature.  All of these areas have opportunities in business leadership later on where an MBA would benefit.  As you work thru your Junior and Senior years, you will have opportunities to explore leadership roles like student council, prom planning, campus newspaper, athletic team leader, etc.  You can explore these options and try to identify what direction your passions are going.  There are campus councilors available as well that you should utilize.  Being successful in business requires building a network of supporters and contacts.  Your councilors have contacts who are willing to meet and talk to you about their specialties.  Use those resources.  Do not be afraid to ask.  Asking only displays leadership and any leader knows that the word ""No"" is going to show up more than ""Yes"" so getting used to it is an important skill.  You may have opportunity to get summer jobs.  Look for something that will help you by weeding out options rather than just getting a paycheck.  If animals are your passion, look at shelters or pet hotels.  Some vets will take summer help as well.  If it is numbers, look for something in an office.  I know my son found a furniture store that needed some part time help during the summer to do paperwork so do not make assumptions about what options are out there.  Use GlassDoor to look for jobs that have what you are looking for.  I have found that it is a great source of options.  Do not worry about not having a ""great"" resume yet.  Everyone in business knows that it takes time to build one.  Just use examples of how you demonstrate leadership (church, school, athletics, etc.) and what you are interested in doing.   When you get to College, use the same plan.  There are companies which provide internships which provide both opportunity to learn as well as contacts.  Your councilors will know where to find them.  I assume you will be pursuing an undergrad degree in business since you indicate you are looking to get an MBA.  A business degree can have several specialty areas so unless you have discovered where your passion lies, take advantage of the diversity. Most of all, do not get discouraged if your passion does not show itself or even if it changes over time.  Life is a journey and we change with every new experience.  Follow the path your passion leads and no matter what, you will be happier than if you take a job just because of the pay. Good luck on your journey."
"After getting a MBA, how do you choose a career that fits both your qualifications and your personal interests?"," Before you skip to the step of deciding on an MBA, you should think about what your major will be in college. You will need to complete 3-4 years of college before you can even apply for an MBA.  Undergraduate college is a great time to explore your interests and decide how you want to proceed in your career.  I highly recommend that students use their summers, in between semesters, to look for internships that will allow you to  notry' a certain career for a few months.  If you are not able to get a paid internship, then try volunteering in an area that is related to your field.  You can volunteer at a church in their business office, volunteer to be a CPAs helper when they are preparing taxes for free.  Work at the library which allows you to be in a place where you can do hours of research.   If you get creative, you can learn about numerous careers in areas that are sort-of related to business.  While you can not volunteer for a law firm, you can work with the Himan Rights Campaign which gets help and support from lawyers all the time and spends a lot of time asking business companies for donations.  They also do extensive research on business court cases.  And political campaigns always need help during voting season.  Yes you will learn about politics. But there are other areas if you apply yourself.  You can learn about zoning, housing prices, neighborhood demographics, all sorts of activities that could be helpful to a future entrepreneur or business owner.       At the end of college, then you can consider the next steps for your career, be that an MBA or finding work in your field.  Keep in mind, some MBA programs prefer you to have some work experience as well.  So the MBA decision should be made much later.    "
"After getting a MBA, how do you choose a career that fits both your qualifications and your personal interests?","Hello Sonia,  You sound very ambitious! I am impressed that you are thinking about your career in the long term.  My advice to you would be to consider narrowing your focus a little more to the near term.  For you, that would be undergraduate studies.  Undergrad is the perfect time to explore your interests further and develop a stronger sense of where you might want to go post undergrad.  You are absolutely correct about the varied opportunities available to you with a business degree.  The world of business is very broad and I would challenge you to use undergrad to determine which specific focus best suits your interests, i.e. Finance, Marketing, Accounting, Information Systems, International Business, etc...  I strongly believe that if you let your passions guide you, you will naturally gravitate towards something that you are both talented in and interested in.  Your expectation should not be that you will find the right fit immediately, however.  Even with an MBA, you are not guaranteed a dream role. What an MBA will afford you is more foundational education, more tailored experience and hopefully a broader network of professionals with who you can connect with to find that perfect role.   Best of luck in all your future endeavors! Ashley"
"After getting a MBA, how do you choose a career that fits both your qualifications and your personal interests?"," I agree with both what Ashley and Wayne stated. Having the ambition for an MBA is excellent at a younger age, but the steps before it are just as important. There are many great undergraduate business degrees out there that will start opening the door to what you might be passionate about within the business world. And beyond that undergrad degree, getting out into the world and testing the waters of the business world for a while before setting your sights on the that MBA.   If I would have gotten my graduate degree immediately after my undergrad it would have been in something different than I ended up getting. It took me getting out into the working world and testing the waters for years to really come to the realization that an MBA focused in Marketing was what I needed to take my passion in business to the next level.   Take each step as its own journey. You know you are going to want to go back for an MBA eventually, but enjoy each step along the way and absorbed as much information and different experiences as you go.   Good luck!   David     "

Is it worth paying that extra out of state tuition?," Hi Christiane,     The 'worth' of any college experience is very much up to you! A little cliche, I know, but the worth you get out of higher education is very dependent on the particular experience you are looking for.  With a little research, you may be able to find an in-state school that checks the right boxes for you in terms of programs, campus life, city and cultural surroundings, and so on. But going out of state to a potentially new environment can be a broadening experience as well.     A few things can help you make some decisions: if you are able to, try to schedule campus visits to some schools that interest you, both in-state and out-of-state (if traveling is an option). You can also speak to your guidance counselor or advisor and see if there are any alumni from your high school that are attending a school of interest and if they would be willing to give you some feedback on the overall experience and it is value. There are also many organizations that provide scholarship and grant opportunities that could help lessen the cost or cover it all together, so keep that in mind. I have included a link I used when applying to schools as a starting point for financial and institution advice and resources.      Overall, look for what feels right to you. If you can find a program in your home state that provides what you are looking for, that is great! If there is a school out-of-state that seems to be more in line with your college goals, then consider those cost benefits as well! Hope this helps and good luck!

Is it a good idea to put some of the modules/subjects taken at college in the resume?,"I always carry a binder with examples of my work with me to interviews. Supplemental information should be readily available to prospective employers. It will show organization and foresight.  Mine includes:  1. Copies of resume 2. Reference sheets  3. Copies of awards/certificates 4. Transcripts 5. Key work examples - Projects pertaining to work area 6. Detailed work history with dates 7. Job descriptions and employer summaries of those positions I am applying for  I believe, if you lack professional experience, resume should be short and to the point. Honesty is key. Project work could potentially be listed in the education section but you want to keep it short or else it will go into the waste bin. If an employer cites specific examples of work where you have project completion but not hands on completion, talk to it in the interview or create a section in the resume listing key courses under education. The magic words: ""I do not yet have the hands on experience in that area yet but I have completed course work and/or projects which pertain to the subject matter. I have no doubt I will learn what is needed quickly.""   Good luck!"
Is it a good idea to put some of the modules/subjects taken at college in the resume?," Yes, do briefly describe the subjects you have studied and the projects you have done when they are relevant to the job in question. Even though you do not have hands-on experience, you do have knowledge, which tells an employer something about the learning curve you will be on. NDT is a perfect example of a topic relevant for an Inspection Engineer.   In addition, having the relevant terms on the CV will help you get through the screening and improve your chances of getting an interview.    For a new graduate, it is often best to list these topics/projects with your education. Doing so helps the employer understand a bit more about your particular course of study, which differentiates you at least a little from everyone else with similar degrees and strengthens your resume.

What setting would be the best for me to work in as a physical therapist?," To be honest, most PT students come in to PT school thinking they want to work in sports PT or outpatient orthopedic PT (clinic). There are so many different options besides the ones you listed including home health, skilled nursing facilities, schools, pediatrics, women is health, long term acute care, etc., and you do not really know which you will like best until you work in that setting as an aide in undergraduate or in an internship during PT school. Many of my classmates changed their minds about what they wanted to do after clinicals. Many work in multiple settings, and love it! Find opportunities to work as an aide, shadow or volunteer in the settings you think you will like best. A very small percentage PTs work with professional sports teams and they are usually more experienced. There are more opportunities to work with college athletes, high school athletes, dance companies, etc. if you think sports therapy is your path.  "
What setting would be the best for me to work in as a physical therapist?," I would highly recommend completing an athletic training program instead of physical therapy. Athletic training is more specific to your desire to work in sports. You will also get a chance to work with sports teams around your school and get hands on experience which will help build your confidence. It is more difficult to find a job in the sports field just because it  is more specific. But just because it is harder, does not mean that you should not go for it. "

How difficult it is to get into the game-developing industry?," It is extremely competitive, and starting out you will have to accept low pay and not-so-glamorous work.  Like, Deer Hunter or Mary-Kate and Ashley Dress-Up games, not Diablo or Assassin is Creed.  But if you do your time, you can get to the more fun stuff.  One friend of mine is involved in Elder Scrolls Online.  Another released the indy game Deathspank.  I almost went into video games a few years into my career, but did not want to take a huge step backward, to internship-levels of pay.  Remember, people can learn to program in their basements, and a company does not need to pay beta testers any more, so you really have to prove your worth to them before they let you get to the more fun and/or lucrative stuff.  Or start your own games company if you have an idea, talent, and a few friends.   "
How difficult it is to get into the game-developing industry?," The games industry is very competitive, but there are many career paths that can lead to a career at a game developer (marketing, design, programming, business). However, positions at large game studios are limited—especially game design positions—and you need to have a strong portfolio of projects, concepts and experience to present and discuss as part of the hiring process.    Most game companies are interested in hiring applicants with some kind of ""real-world"" games industry experience. They want to know that you understand the process of creating and publishing a game from start to finish. Working on games in the classroom is a great way to understand the process, but you usually do not have enough time or bandwidth to create a finished game. You can gain extra experience through industry internships, or also by teaming up with classmates to create and launch your own game. Having a passion for video games is a good start, but you also need to gain the right skills and knowledge base to make an impact at a game studio.   Just because a career path is competitive does not mean you should not pursue it—but you will need to work hard and develop the necessary skills and experience to land a position.  "
How difficult it is to get into the game-developing industry?," Yes, it is hard and competitive and in this market there is a bit of a bias for candidates with industry experience.  So how do you get it in?  What can you do now to help increase your chances of getting a job in games?   Well, happily one thing has happened that has changed the rules over the last few years is the rise of independent and crowdfunded game projects.  And the second cool thing that has happened was mobile gaming took off.  The rules and landscape is different now for potential job seekers that want to enter this market.     There is the traditional path - attend a school focused on game design or art in games, build a portfolio and submit.  There are many excellent 2 and 4 year trade schools that will spin you up in all the tools and knowledge you will need to to at the very least compete for these jobs.   While I do recommend taking this coursework at the collegiate level because you need the fundamentals, I also highly encourage you start thinking now about independent games you can begin to design now and work with friends to build.  If you spend time in the Minecraft community alone, you could build up an immense vocabulary of gaming, learn how to design your own levels, and perhaps if you are ambitious begin to design your own game based on user generated content.   When I look at applicants, if they have designed their own games, whether that is a mod or something operational on mobile, that is a massive plus over other candidates.  It shows ambition and passion.    "
How difficult it is to get into the game-developing industry?," The industry has become quite competitive, and there is more competition every day as more colleges are offering art, design, or engineering programs geared towards the video game industry.  There is also a constant flow of existing talent in the industry as game production reaches completion, companies evolve or downsize, or people looking for a new or different challenge.  At the same time there are new companies forming all the time and it is getting easier to set up shop on your own or with a small group of people and publishing games on your own has been much easier than even a few years ago.  I have found making games a rewarding career and industry full of creative and talented people, I learn something new almost every day and I am closing in on 20 years of work.  It is exciting, challenging, creative, and the constant changes make for never a dull moment.  It is not for everyone, but my advice, if you have a passion for games, or for any of the disciplines that make up the core of game jobs, pursue that passion.  Even if you find after studying and building your skills that making games is not for you, you will be left with a great base for pursuing a number of other careers.  My immediate advice, play games, and yes have fun but also start developing a critical eye, what makes the game fun, what mechanics does the game use to challenge you, or tell a story, or make you want to keep playing, ask yourself how did they do that, and start a search for answers.  Each area of game development has a different skill set, though some overlap.  I can talk most directly about art.  There are many tools to learn, and you should learn them, but it all start with drawing.  Draw.  Draw every day.  Then draw some more.  Learn about color and play with it.  Make mistakes and learn from them.  Show people your work and listen and observe how they respond.   And be inspired, by what you see and hear, sure games, movies, music, but also what surrounds you every day, people on the bus, light reflecting off buildings, the food you eat.  All of this will continue to build your confidence, and you will start believing in your passion, and it will take you places. "
How difficult it is to get into the game-developing industry?," The gaming industry has becoming more and more accessible for everyone! I think you definitely can get into the industry if you figure out your passion - programming, art, design, management and what not. The best way would be to continue doing what you do - taking classes related to what you passion for. Also, make sure you apply to various companies for an internship. I got my first full time job after working with the company as an intern. Good luck!  "

Computer science college graduates do-over?," Writing.  Better writing is useful, and the structure in a college course can be good to improve yourself there.     Anything technical that you really need to know, you can spend time to learn after school anyways.  Sort of the nice thing about comp sci, everything is changing, there is always tons to learn.  Another thing to keep in mind is that both the breadth and depth available in undergraduate degree programs is actually quite small compared to what you learn on the job.  It is more about foundation.     Just take hard classes and learn how to learn a bunch.  Program a lot.     Oh yea take some statistics if it is not required.  Even if it is required, consider taking some more. "
Computer science college graduates do-over?," Hello Brian,     It is a wise question you raise. I believe there are at least two answers: answer one is related to how advance your career and answer two is how to find greater happiness in your career and life?     The good news is I believe you can have and to some degree you need both. Although it is possible to compartmentalize your life into work and play,  generally you will find you do not have time to indulge in one or the other independently the way you imagine. Therefore, if one of your personal goals is to travel, then getting a job that allows for and even enables traveling would be a win win personally and in your career. If you are interested in community service securing a job that has a 'greater good' policy or initiative would allow you to do good while you work or at least in association with work.     That said, it is important to understand companies pay you to accomplish some task for which they receive revenue. If you work for a plumbing firm and you install a toilet and a water heater, the relationship between the task you performed and company revenue is pretty clear. If you are a programmer and your performing bug fixes, it is a little less direct, but the thinking is better software product quality translates to improved customer satisfaction and ultimately greater sales.     Assuming the tasks you know how to perform are in demand, the  more complex and specialized your competencies are, the more your company can charge for your skills and the more you will get compensated. Much of the time, that complexity and specialization is related to domain knowledge not better programming skills. For example, knowing about the retail or the banking business will allow you to communicate more effectively with your retail or banking users and allow you to create more valuable products. Therefore, if you get excited about the stock market or online stores, then developing expertise in that kind of business will make you a more valuable programmer and, presumably,  increase your engagement and satisfaction at work.     Education does not end with college,  so rather than try and cram as much training as you can in college, it is probably more important to have a long term strategy that marries your technical skills to a specific business, government or non-profit domain about which you care.  In the beginning, you will probably be pushed enough just learning to program the way your company wants you to program. However, in time, that will not seem so challenging and, assuming it would be fun for you to learn about a domain that interests you, then that blending should yield a better balance in your overall skill set.     In short, understanding yourself enough to know the things that matter most to you and which, in doing, bring you pleasure lays the foundation for integrating your CompSci skills with that lifestyle. If approached in the right way, instead of competing for your personal time, your CompSci skills will open doors to doing things you want to do and care about (e.g. travel, social causes, learning about life). So if you want to minor in a field, I would recommend that decision is based more on your curiosities or interests so you can begin to develop domain expertise to compliment your technical expertise.

What is the difference between a Nurse Practitioner and PA?," The major difference between nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) is that NPs specialize during their education and practice in that specialty while PAs are prepared as generalists and do not have a specialty.      For example, as a NP, I specialized in psychiatry/mental health. My graduate education was in psychiatric/mental health nursing and my specialty certification is as a family psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. If I wanted to change careers later in life and work in a family medical clinic, I would have to go back to school and obtain a post-masters certification in family nursing and pass the family nurse practitioner certification exam.      If I were a PA, I would complete my PA graduate program and pass the PA exam. After this, I could work essentially anywhere I would like and my ""specialization"" would occur with on-the-job training.     NPs can practice without the supervision of a physician in numerous states. PAs do not have independent practice and must have physician supervision which is defined by the individual states.     NPs also have experience in healthcare as registered nurses and have undergraduate degrees in nursing. PAs may or may not have experience working in healthcare and typically have an undergraduate degree in biology, chemistry, pre-med, or other science degrees.      Both PAs and NPs must have a minimum of a masters degree in order to practice.

What is the difference between the certificates and associate in science (AS) degree in accounting?," I may add that most programs that have ""Associate"" next to them usually refer to a 2 year degree , for instance at a community college.  As mentioned above, a Bachelors degree is the way to go if you would like to be a full-fledged accountant. A Bachelors degree will give you enough credits to be able to sit for Accounting designations like CPA, CMA.   All the best "
What is the difference between the certificates and associate in science (AS) degree in accounting?," Hi Ayomide!    The main difference between a certificate and an Associates is that the certificate may not include academic courses such as English Composition or Math. The aim of a certificate is to give you the skills and training needed so you can go to the work force sooner.  However, just so you are aware, if you are planning on becoming an accountant - a Bachelor is degree is highly recommended.  "
How can we have a professional yet diverse Resume to apply to jobs and be eye catching without having to create different resumes?," Regarding the use of different resumes... you can create a basic resume to reflect your experience and accomplishments, however,  my advice is to review each job opening and then make sure you tailor your resume.  You want to make sure you use key words from the position requirements and emphasize areas in the resume that will show what a great fit you are based on your skills and background.       I highly recommend the books by Robin Ryan  ""Winning Resumes"", ""Winning Cover Letters"" and ""60 Seconds and You are Hired "" to help with writing a good resume as well as the entire job search process.     ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS include a personal and powerful cover letter.  When attaching your resume to an online application, make sure the cover letter and resume are in the same attachment (and in that order).  Most hiring personnel will not open a cover letter, but if in the same doc, your information has a greater chance of being seen with the bonus of getting more key word ""hits"" by including the cover letter with the resume.       I do NOT recommend paying someone to create your resume for you.  Do the work yourself, as your resume needs to reflect YOU and you need to be familiar with every word and phrase.     Spell check!!  Grammar check!!          "
How can we have a professional yet diverse Resume to apply to jobs and be eye catching without having to create different resumes?," Hey Ingrid, there is no getting around it.  You MUST have a variety of resumes / distinctive versions  for different positions and industries. If you do not, you will come across as lazy to a potential employer and may never snag an interview. Writing a stellar resume that includes an engaging summary, targeted keywords, excellent grammar / punctuation, relevant experience / education, and proof of expertise is  TIME CONSUMING!  However, if you wish to have a chance as a competitive prospective employee, you must put in the time! That may not be what you want to hear, but you have to tailor each resume to a specific position.  There are no shortcuts!      Best wishes to you!     Warmly,  erinn e. "
How can we have a professional yet diverse Resume to apply to jobs and be eye catching without having to create different resumes?," Sorry, that is the way it is . . . what I tell my customers is to take the time with each resume, When, and only When, it is a job you really want. If it is just another position you are applying to because, well, you need a job, then any resume will do. However, do not expect results either!  The other thing wrong with not tweaking it each time is, statistically, you will experience lots more incidents of nobody calling you back after you submit the resume, which, quite honestly, gets pretty depressing. If you walk into an interview already discouraged, odds are you will not do your best.     Bottom line: do your best at everything you do! "

Ways to Deal with Stress," Hi - First, give yourself credit for recognizing your stress and the need to do something about it.&nbsp; Stress is unhealthy (especially long term stress) and it is important to find a healthy balance between work and personal life. There are some basic things to do:&nbsp; eat well, exercise, get enough sleep, and find something you enjoy to relax, some of which can take 5-10 minutes and be done a few times a day&nbsp;(e.g., meditate, relaxation exercises, breathing exercises - breathe in 3-4 seconds, then&nbsp;exhale 6-8 seconds to relax your&nbsp;central nervous system).&nbsp; Have you thought about what would make you happier in your current position?&nbsp; Perhaps you can develop a plan to share with your bosses about how to better address the stress makers.&nbsp; Is there another position in your company that interests you?&nbsp; Often, companies like it when employees gain experience in multiple areas of the business.&nbsp; Best wishes!

Ways to Deal with Stress," Hi Matthew! Recognizing signs of stress and potential burnout is important to being able to work to reduce it. It is great to hear that you have a supportive work environment, as that can help you manage your stress. Keep in mind, while it is important to be present at work, it is also important to take time off and follow a self care routine. Many people do not recognize the importance in scheduling time off, as that can help with feeling burnt out. Remember to take time for yourself and focus on activities that relax you, such as reading, exercising,&nbsp;spending time with friends etc. &nbsp; "

How do I know what is my passion?," Start thinking about what you love /like . Of course some of these areas would be your passion, hobbies etc. For me personally, I always liked numbers as well as meeting a lot of new people. I started off as a computer science major but felt that I was sitting all day in a lab programming. So, I decided to switch my major to Finance and am now a Finance Management consultant which helps me satisfy both my number crunching as well as meet new people/clients on a regular basis. "
How do I create my own internship opportunity?," Hello Deana! Great questions. The fact that you are thinking about these things and are eager to get an internship shows you have a bright future. To answer your questions:      1) The best way to approach these organizations is ""to be a squeaky wheel"". ""The squeaky wheel gets the oil"" is an old saying but this piece of advice has opened so many doors for me throughout my career. Just because they do not post an internship opportunity does not mean they would not love some extra help.  All you have to do is ask.      2) Here are my suggested steps for you to take:          1- Write down what skills and experiences you already have and what skills you would like to learn and grow          2- Research local organizations (go on their website, look at any articles they have been mentioned in).          3- First see if anyone you know knows someone at that organization and could give you a warm introduction. If you do not have a connection to the organization, that is completely fine! A lot of organizations will still be happy to hear from you.          4-Email them and explain your situation. Ask to meet in person.          5- When you meet in person, talk about their programs that you researched and how you would like to help with them. They will be impressed that you did your research. Even though you did your research and came up with your own ideas—also talk about how you would be happy to do whatever other work they need help with.      Hope this helps! Best of luck! "
How do I create my own internship opportunity?,"Hi Deana - That is great that you are thinking about taking the initiative and reaching out to nonprofits or departments that you are interested in. I would first take the time to think about the skills that you would be able to provide the nonprofit or government agency.   Do you have any prior work, volunteering or school experience that you could share? For example, I volunteered with a nonprofit organization focused on homelessness and helped them build their tracking system for members and suggested ideas for new volunteer orientations. Those were skills I did not have as a result of my major (accounting) but projects that I worked on and skills I developed that could be used for future employment.   When you have your list of skills, do some research (news, their website, social media) on the organizations you are interested in.  Reach out to those organizations and explain the skills that you have and a few projects you could help them with. Take a look at https://idealistcareers.org/category/career-planning/ for some ideas of Career Planning in the social impact space.  Best of luck!  Suzanne"
How do I create my own internship opportunity?," That is fantastic that you want to create your own opportunity!

How do you handle or bounce back from a PR crisis?,"First, know yourself. Make up your mind early that, for instance, you never swear on the job. Period. Or you never talk about anyone negatively with anyone else at work. Period.  If you want to talk about someone, wait til you get home. Make these rules for yourself and never break them. It will save you more trouble than I can tell you."
How do you handle or bounce back from a PR crisis?," Jordan,     The good news is that as a PR professional, unless you specifically decide to focus on crisis communications, the liklihood of having to deal with a major crisis is relatively slim. That being said, it can happen. In my 20+ year career in Public Relations and Communications I have had to deal with one major crisis (an incident of workplace violence). The good news is that the company bounced back and is doing well.     The three biggest factors in making it through a crisis in a position to bounce back are planning, transparency and flexibility.     Planning: Develop a comprehensive crisis communications plan; involve the right people and ensure they know their roles in case a crisis hits (remember that a major crisis is not just a communications issue - tap the resources you may need such as legal, product development, HR, etc.); develop a message framework that can be rapidly fleshed out as information is gathered; identify the right spokespeople and ensure they are prepared to deliver information in as timely a manner as possible for as long as the crisis exists.     Transparency: Be as honest as possible; if you are in the wrong, accept responsibility and apologize; do not try to shift blame; if appropriate, outline plans to address the root cause of the crisis, even if it was not strictly your fault; keep the lines of communication open and continue to answer all of the questions you can; do not go silent.     Flexibility: Remember that things do not always go according to plan; be prepared to pivot if necessary; adapt the plan based on new information; Do not panic. "
How do you handle or bounce back from a PR crisis?, First a great PR person handles each situation the exact same especially when it is a crisis. The calm cool head is what you need to develop so that you can deal with a crisis when it comes time.  Having a crisis plan is the next step in being ready to handle a PR crisis but that is an entirely different discussion.  
How do you handle or bounce back from a PR crisis?," Hi Jordan. Great question. Theresa makes some great points about avoiding personal PR crises.     If you are asking how to prepare to handle a professional client is PR crisis, that is more complicated. Some PR professionals do specialize in handling a PR crisis that arises for a company, an executive, a celebrity or a politician. If they do not handle it right for the client, they can lose their jobs, families and friends.     The best PR people are able to think quickly and think on their feet. You can not be afraid to tell the person or company you represent what you think. Chances are they are going to be in panic mode and watching their company, career, marriage, and finances all go down the drain at once. This is incredibly stressful and they usually will not be thinking rationally. That is what the PR pro is there for.     One of the best learning tools you have is just watching how people in the public eye are handling crises that hit them. You can always find a company or politician or actor that is having a problem. Usually they have someone who stands out in front and handles the media. Watch how they handle things.     For example, you are lucky right now (or unlucky) that there seem to be a ton of PR crises going on all around us. All the sexual harassment allegations that are coming out of Hollywood and Washington DC are excellent examples of how to handle (and how  not  to handle) a PR crises. As we have seen it is very easy for a powerful person like Harvey Weinstein or Steve Wynn to lose control of their companies that they themselves built.     Luckily we also have the internet so you can easily also look back and see how well or how poorly some people handled PR crises that they were faced with. Look at things like videos, press releases, and newspaper articles. Try to watch and read things in chronological order so you can get a sense of how the story unfolds and how the PR spin changes, depending on what is going on in the press and with public opinion. For politicians, check out their favorability polls from before, during and a few years after.      Some great events that I would suggest you look at are:    The Deepwater Horizon Disaster  - This happened a few years ago (there is a new movie out too). It involved an oil rig that blew up and leaked a ton of oil into the Gulf of Mexico for a long time before they could fix it. British Petroleum did some things well and some things not. Senior management at BP were indicted criminally. Does not get much worse. See how the PR people handled it.   The Las Vegas Shooting  - The recent mass shooting in Las Vegas is another interesting one. The most interesting aspects are how the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Vegas police department have handled all the attention. It is very sad and horrible, so if you do not care to read about this one I do not blame you.   The Bill Clinton Impeachment  - Incredibly interesting study in how how professional politicians handle scandal that they created. Clinton had many really good, smart people handling the spin. Worth watching again. He is popular again so it worked.    The Current FBI Scandal  - This one is ongoing and it is interesting to see how a real PR crisis unfolds. It is particular interesting to watch the drip, drip, drip of new facts come out just when you think it can not get any worse it does.   Britney Spears' or Amanda Bynes' Meltdowns  - Classic.   There are plenty of other good crises out there to study. Find some that appeal to you. "
What to do for money in the meantime while looking for a job?," Networking is the best way to get a job.  Approach family and friends, with a great resume and ask them to present it to potential employers with their advocacy.  Also ask if they will meet with you for 30 minutes to do a mock interview or review your resume.  During the time ask a lot of great questions and their advice to get a job.  People are a lot more apt to help find you a position in a face to face situation.  Not as desirable, but post on your neighborhoods Facebook sells page that you are seeking a position, your experience and if anyone has a recommendation.  Good luck!  It only take one. "
What to do for money in the meantime while looking for a job?," Hi Alec,   Summer naturally supplies several opportunities due to the demands of this time of year.  Back in the day, I worked as a pool boy, landscaper, and helped out at a restaurant during the high season (summer).  Another popular profession would be to work for uber.  I have heard several success stories from folks working there.  Craigslist and classified ads in your local paper often post positions needed around your area.  Good luck. "
What to do for money in the meantime while looking for a job?," I agree with Jeremy is comments. You could focus on dental offices to see if they are in need of summer assistance whether it is as a receptionist or other support staff. In addition, many businesses look for summer support to offset staffing needs while permanent employees are on vacation. After graduation, I worked for a major bank as a floating teller. it was steady work and i would spend two weeks in a branch supplementing staff before moving on to next location. "

As a music education major should I go straight to masters or wait and work with a school?," Hello Caleb, I do not think there is only one right answer to this. I would consider what your interests are. Do you want to teach at a elementary, middle , high school level, university? What do you think conducting would add to your credentials?  Spending some time teaching before going back to school has the advantage that you gain professional experience that  might give you a better perspective of what your options are so you would go back to school knowing what you want to get from school. On the other hand, if you decide to continue and do a masters degree, that could potentially open other professional jobs that require a higher degree. It seems you have time to decide, since you are a freshman. Continue with the good work and use these years to broaden your options taking classes in conducting and other subjects and you will find your answer when the time comes and always use the resources available to you at school, ask your advisers and mentors. Good luck! "

What post-secondary school educational requirements are there to become a hair stylist?," Hi Tashina,  I previously worked for Empire Education Group (Empire Beauty Schools) and can tell you it depends on what state you want to work in. Every state has different education requirements, which usually include attending an approved cosmetology program (either at a private school or a vocational school) for a minimum amount of educational hours (1000 to 2000 hours depending on the state). Once you complete the required education hours, you will need to take and pass the State Licensing Exam to be a licensed cosmetologist and work in a salon.     If you already at a 4-year college, I would recommend starting Cosmetology school once you are done with your degree as most programs are semi-full time (35 hours a week). "
What post-secondary school educational requirements are there to become a hair stylist?," Several people I know have gone right from high school to a school of cosmetology to gain experience. The length of program can vary but I am sure you will be able to manage a part time job and courses depending on your current time management skills. Because you are graduating ""Career-ready"", you will be able to begin the job search soon after completing the program.  "
What is the most beneficial thing to do now in order to become a professional dancer?," The most important thing that you can do is to determine if dance is indeed the best career area for you and also to prepare yourself for an alternate career, if and when you are no longer able to participate in this career area.  Too often careers end prematurely and people are not able to cope with life after that as they have adequate preparation with an alternate plan.       Getting to know yourself and how your personality traits relate to people involved in various career opportunities is very important in your decision making process. During my many years in Human Resources and College Recruiting, I ran across too many students who had skipped this very important step and ended up in a job situation which for which they were not well suited. Selecting a career area is like buying a pair of shoes. First you have to be properly fitted for the correct size, and then you need to try on and walk in the various shoe options to determine which is fits the best and is most comfortable for you to wear. Following are some important steps which I developed during my career which have been helpful to many . "
What is the most beneficial thing to do now in order to become a professional dancer?, The most important thing you need to know is whether dancing gives you the new and additional energy in your life and whether dancing allows you to be someone who is free to be and free to act.  I know of various professional dancers across the globe who are enjoying their work and some had made good income due to various oversea teaching trips. The pathway for dancer has increased significantly over the years and more people in Asia and Latin America are picking up dancing and they are making it as part of their lifestyle.  You decide what kind of dance do you want to be specialized in and you have to train your body well. Good luck.

"If a person does not have any prior work experience, what do you look at to determine if you would like them to work for your company?"," If a job applicant has a resume that literally shows only a degree, and nothing else, I would be very unlikely to put their resume into the ""invite for an interview"" pile. Normally resumes have degrees, clubs, awards, any past jobs (even if they are not in relevant fields), past internships, volunteering, hobbies, interests, and other achievements. It is hard to imagine a candidate really not having any of those things but having a college degree. If you ever feel like you might not have anything riding for you other than your degree I would say (1) you are probably selling yourself short by not recognizing how awesome your hobbies are^, and (2) there is always time to get started right now. You could be volunteering within days!      ^ For example I have heard often that people who play video games often do not think that time is worthy of bragging about, but then you find out in an interview that they are actually super accomplished at this one video game and are a leader of a clan and have huge respect among their peers, and you wonder why they did not mention that before!

What they do, what subsidiaries they spin off, their financial statement, the corporate prospectus, the CEOs name, the CEO is dog is name... everything you can dig up online or at the library or in corporate literature.   Now,  think very hard how you can be of service to this company.  What do you offer?  What makes you stand out that is not on your slim resume?   Tell me in a cover letter about why you will be worth hiring.  What do you bring to my company? What makes you qualified or able to perform the job?   And you better spell everything correctly and use perfect grammar and punctuation... or do not expect an interview from me.   If you do get an interview be ready to back up anything you said in your cover letter... NO Blowing Smoke - it only takes a minute to see through a phony.   I ran an organization of 60 people and did all my own hiring.   "

What does a software engineer do on a day to day basis?," It varies hugely, depending on the industry (a game developer might have very different responsibilities from someone who works at an ISP like Comcast or Verizon, for example), and depending on the team of people they are working with.   For me, on any given day I am usually in the middle of improving an existing piece of software. Most of my projects take multiple days to weeks to complete. Today, I am just finishing up making a small change that a customer who uses the program I work on asked for. I am also adding a new ability to a program that I wrote over the past year. Finally, I am working with another software engineer to make a plan for how we are going to clean up a very messy piece of code over the next week or so. This last one means writing a document describing ""Here is what we hope to accomplish, here is how we think we are going to approach it, and here is what might go wrong."" It is not writing code, but it is still an important part of the process. "

What is it like to teach English at the high school and college level?," Hi Sabrina,      Great question! I am not an English Teacher myself, but I went through undergrad and pursued a BFA in English Literature, so I have had the opportunity to connect with a lot of professors in the field.      I think one thing to keep in mind, is that no matter what option you peruse--whether it is to teach at a high school or college--is that you will potentially find more passionate students in specialized courses, rather than generalized ones. A population of passionate students can make or break a class you are in, and will determine the pace and what the professor gets to cover. If you are passionate about Shakespeare, for example, and you have the opportunity to teach the plays you really enjoy, then I think you will have a great time! Just remember, you will always have classes that you like better than others, but if you find the subjects in English that you are passionate about, then I think you will enjoy teaching High School and/or college. Keep in mind, your level of education that is required changes with where/what level you teach, so factor that into your consideration as well.      I hope this helps! Continue leveraging your resources and asking great questions, and do not feel like you have to make a decision right now. Once you start University, you will have a lot of time to consider your options.      Will "
